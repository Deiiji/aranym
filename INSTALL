1) Compilation requirements
---------------------------

For compiling ARAnyM you will need libSDL, version at least 1.2.x.
You can get it from http://www.libsdl.org/ or from your OS distribution vendor.

If you want to compile source fetched from CVS you also need
automake, libtool and autoconf (http://www.gnu.org/ or your OS vendor).

Supported platforms:

All Debian GNU/Linux platforms

and

x86          GNU/Linux
x86          MS Windows + Cygwin
x86          OpenBSD
PPC          MacOS X
SGI          Irix
Sun Sparc    Solaris

In progress (in alphabetical order):
m68k         FreeMiNT
x86          FreeBSD


2) Compilation
--------------
If you run a flavour of Unix or Linux, go to src/Unix folder.

If you got the source code from CVS then type
./autogen.sh && make

If you have a source snapshot or proper ARAnyM source code release then type
./configure && make

./configure --help shows you all the compile time options.

If everything went OK you got an executable file named "aranym".


3) Installation
---------------
You may install ARAnyM by typing 'make install' (root privileges expected)
or you may run the binary directly by typing ./aranym.

Next step is to obtain the operating system (TOS 4.04 or EmuTOS) and install
a harddrive. More on this in the README file.


4) Troubleshooting
------------------

If you compiled libSDL by yourself and installed to /usr/local/ you might
experience the following problem when running autogen.sh:

aclocal: configure.in: 835: macro `AM_PATH_SDL' not found in library

The fix is relatively easy:

export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/local/share/aclocal"

This helps aclocal to find the .m4 file and everything is fine then.
