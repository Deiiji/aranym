Things to do (written by Joy, volunteers ask in the mailing list)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO generally:
- configurable insertion of floppy on bootup (perhaps also IDE CD?)

TODO in keyboard support:
- editable hotkeys (releasing input grab, Setup GUI, PrintScreen) [0.8.8]
- runtime switch between symtable and scantable [0.8.8]
- loadable keyboard layout (similar to hatari) [0.8.8]
- editable keyboard layout (need WYSIWYG - impossible in 320x200) [0.9.0?]

TODO in GUI-SDL:
- create AlertBox() for the GUI-SDL
- open up GUI whenever the config file is not found (so that users can edit
  the default values before saving them). [0.8.8]
- Apply changes automatically before Save Config and perhaps also before Reboot
- simple window/fullscreen switch
- change GUI font loading routine - load standard TOS font (2048/4096 bytes)
  directly (instead of some MS Windows bitmap) [0.9.0]
- fileselector: sorting by file type (folders first) and then by file .ext
- edit field: allow upper case
- create other dialogs for editing the rest of config file settings
- include disk image generator that updates the config file with proper CHS

TODO in TOS patches and utilities:
- automatic updater of BDCONFIG.SYS
- PureC patch more error-proof
- separate mouse driver from Clocky and make it NatFeat based
- enforce 0x50000 _MCH value (warn user if they have 0x30000)
- finish and publish TOS XHDI disk driver

TODO in documentation:
- update the man page (and fix two manpages in RPM)
- README and doc/documentation.txt largely overlap. Must be fixed ASAP
  by stripping down the README to a few basic instructions and
  extending/revising and rewriting the documentation.txt into an useful
  and up-to-date aranym documentation (aranym.txt would be a better name).
- keep working on ARAnyM Hackers Guide (hguide.txt).

TODO in ARAnyM source code itself:
- add proper copyright header to every edited file (see main.cpp)
- remove RCS keywords (they complicate comparing and merging of revisions)
- clean up, tidy up. Indent. Comment. Document.


ARAnyM Roadmap:
---------------

0.9.0 should come with direct partition access and free XHDI disk driver

1.0.0 should be complete and ready for a CD ISO image distribution
      (installable on a wide range of PC-like hardware).


Some hot ideas (before they get forgotten)
------------------------------------------

Note that the name before a TODO item doesn't mean the item is assigned to
that particular programmer but rather who is author of the idea :-)

- joy: make.sh magic: "nfeth-config.c" build by ./make.sh of the xif.

- joy: write some doc about bridging the tuntap - perhaps the following
       URL could help?
       http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO-3.html#ss3.1

- joy: Clipboard sharing between host and atari. Some URLs for inspiration:
  http://www.idata.sk/~robo/mpcb/
  http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt

  Basic idea: C:\CLIPBRD\SCRAP.TXT is copied to CLIPBOARD on X11 host
  and vice-versa (during input focus changes).

  Extra cool idea: PRIMARY selection on X11 could be stored to IKBD buffer
  directly so it would simulate typing.

- joy: printing to configurable file (/dev/lp)

- joy: ARAnyM should test if SDL timers work OK at startup and if not, stop
       booting and exit gracefully with a loud warning (e.g. on NetBSD).

- joy: emulating a serial port compatible with MiNT/HSMODEM

- Milan: full revision of CPU/FPU instr. set

- Milan: distributed dispatcher for JIT compiler sigsegv handler

- Milan: gdb as debugger for ARAnyM

- Milan: SIGINT ndebug problem solution

- Milan: --with-opengl-prefix

- STanda: hostfs.cpp: enable debug and implement all NOT IMPLEMENTED needed
         methods.

- patrice: rework dsp thread synchronization. It seems it may hang sometimes.

- patrice: full automake/autoconf support.
