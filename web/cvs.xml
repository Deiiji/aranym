      The current development is kept in CVS. The CVS has read-only access for all
      users. Get a CVS client from <A HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/">cvshome.org</A> and type:
      <pre>
  CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.sophics.cz:/var/repos
  export CVSROOT
  cvs login
      </pre>

      When it asks you for a password enter: 
      <pre>
  anoncvs
      </pre>

      Then type:

      <pre>
  cvs -z3 co aranym
      </pre>

      This will create the aranym folder in your current directory.
      Anytime later you can go into that folder and type

      <pre>
  cvs -z3 update
      </pre>

      for updating your source tree to be in sync with the master tree.
      <p/>
      Note: The -z3 sets the compression level - the higher the number the
      higher the compression.
      <p/>
      Please keep in mind that the CVS version may not always work correctly,
      may be unpredictable, etc. The CVS version is a development version and
      should be treated as such.
