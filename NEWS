2001/11/28 - version 0.0.11 released
==========
 The keyboard in aranym should now work properly after loading the updated
 Clocky.prg (with hardwired PC101 English keyboard layout). You can use any
 Atari tool to remap the keyboard to suit your needs.

 Previously there were errors when reading floppies with FastRAM enabled.
 Use the latest FastRAM v2.0 and everything should be OK. Well, apart from
 really large floppies (4 MB and more) from STonX. These are not valid
 floppies but rather single partitions of a harddrive. We will handle them
 when we implement XHDI emulation.

 IKBD emulation was fixed so that Videlity config program works now. Videlity
 is a Falcon screen enhancer (freeware). Get it and enjoy Videl at 1024x768 :)

 fVDI was greatly improved so you might not need to play with Videlity at all.

 The patches for TOS 4.04 were cleaned up a lot. If you were using a prepatched
 TOS version please stop using it and get the original TOS 4.04.

 IDE emulation was fixed so that formatting and partitioning of ext2 by
 MiNT installers work now properly.


2001/11/06
==========
 The TOS patch we used included WinX by a mistake. That's been removed.
 Now you'll need to install real GEMRAM and also WinX to your auto folder
 if you wish to use the WinX AES enhancements. Please note that the
 GEMRAM 1.0 from the Aratools does not work. It actually didn't work for
 a long time. Use the real GEMRAM (that copies ROM to RAM) instead if you
 want to use WinX.


2001/11/01
==========

 Mouse behavior fixed:
  1) you can release mouse grab by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Esc (VMware compatible)
  2) you can grab mouse by click the left mouse button (VMware compatible)
  3) if the Atari mouse driver is active, you can release mouse by moving
     the mouse off the window and by moving back you grab it again. This
     can be disabled by setting "AutoGrabMouse=No" in the config file.

 You can save the config file by 'aranym -s' (or --save). This is useful
 if you want to see newly added options. You can also choose a different
 config file by 'aranym -c /path/to/different/aranymrc'. This even works
 together: 'aranym -c /tmp/aranymrc.example -s' will create a fresh config
 file in /tmp with all default values.


2001/10/29
==========
--rom removed
--floppy added

aranymrc.example updated

.aranymrc has a new option "EmuTOS" that holds a path to the EmuTOS.
When "EmuTOS=" is defined the "TOS=" is ignored (EmuTOS is the future! :)


2001/10/18
==========

Aranym is now able to work with the original TOS 4.04.


2001/10/02
==========
--ttram renamed to --fastram
-T renamed to -F
--grab_mouse and -g removed (mouse is always grabbed)

.aranymrc has a new option "cookie_MCH" that holds hex value.
Example: cookie_MCH = 0x3000 is for standard Falcon _MCH
