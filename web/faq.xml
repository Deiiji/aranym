    <title>What is ARAnyM?</title>
    <text>
      ARAnyM stands for "Atari Running on Any Machine".
      The main aim of the project is to create a software layer
      that would allow anyone to install and use 32bit Atari ST/TT/Falcon
      applications on their computer regardless of its architecture.

    <title>What ARAnyM is NOT?</title>
    <text>
      ARAnyM has never been designed as a complete emulator of any
      Atari machine. Thus we don't use the word "emulator" in any
      context of ARAnyM. ARAnyM emulates only the hardware esentially
      needed for boot the TOS ROM and MiNT in consequence. If you intended
      to play games and (or) launch demos made for ST/E then just forget
      ARAnyM and install some existing emulator created for this purpose
      (STonX, WinSTon, Steem, etc..)

    <title>Why we started ARAnyM?</title>
    <text>
      The TOS compatible platform hardware goes slightly away from scene.
      The Atari hardware products and their clones are one big, nearly
      closed, dying chapter of the TOS platform. The last abitious project,
      Milan II computer, had given it up in late 2000.
      Existing machines are of a rather low performace in comparison with
      any other up-to-date platform. The peripheral development is also
      in convergence to null. On the other hand there exist a big bunch of
      modern applications and quite modern OS with a big potential power.
      These are the things that we would like to keep alive and not to throw
      them away with the old slow hardware stuff. ARAnyM gives the TOS
      platform the ultimate possibility to live on and to take the advantage
      of all features of current modern computer hardware.

    <title>How does it work?</title>
    <text>
      The core is the MC68040 emulation. Yes you read this right it is really
      full featured 040 processor that is emulated! Besides the CPU there
      are several integrated circuits emulation needed to boot and run TOS.
      The platform independece follows the usage of Host OS providing hardware
      dependent drivers and services. The Host OS is nearly invisible to the
      ARAnyM user and thus they need not to pay any attention to it. More info
      about the internal topics are in developer section.

    <title>How does it work? (Technical)</title>
    <text>
      As said. There is a 040 CPU core taken from the UAE (Unix Amiga Emulator).
      The MMU and some patches were added to it. The other circuits emulated are
      mainly ACIA, BLITTER, Falcon VIDEL and IDE and basic input peripherals
      handled by MFP (respective IKBD) like keyboard and mouse.
      Afterburner 040 TOS is used. So ARAnyM has the Falcon 040 Afterburner in degree
      of its big brother. The whole system runs on Host OS (primarily Linux, in future
      maybe Windows, MAC, etc.). Linux system (we call it more generally "Host OS") is
      installed before ARAnyM and after that it is "invisible" to the user. That
      means that ARAnyM user wouldn't nearly notice its presence. It is also possible
      to install ARAnyM in so called "application mode" to already installed and being
      used Host OS. After that you can start ARAnyM like a normal Host OS application in
      its own window and work with it like with other emulators.

    <title>What are the aims in the ARAnyM future development?</title>
    <text>
      Step by step should the missing features be added. These are (sound support,
      accelerated graphics, I/O ports, etc.). The copyright free system should be ideally
      reached. The main licencing problem is the TOS ROM copyright and so a new "ROM"
      should be created just to enable to boot into the Atari FreeMiNT OS. After that
      we would get a multitasking, multiuser, GEM compatible ARAnyM system free
      of all copyright issues, licensed under GPL! The next steps should be a deeper
      integration of other OS parts (FreeMiNT, fVDI, XaAES, Desktop). In future some
      parts of these might run natively in Host OS platform machine code. In a far future
      there can be a totally native ARAnyM system in that could the Host OS native
      applications be compiled and used in cooperation with 68k ones. The Macintosh does
      this (m68k and PowerPC mix) and so it could work for us, too.

    <title>Distribution</title>
    <text>
      The standalone distribution should be created to simplify the installation process.
      This distribution should comprise all components needed to make use of all advantages
      of the hardware used. The Host OS installation (prefferably Linux) as the base followed
      by the ARAnyM application itself further to complete MiNT installation including VDI,
      AES and Desktop. The distribution should contain all tools and applications needed
      to install ARAnyM on a PC hardware. This includes partition tools, peripheral setup tools,
      network setup etc. All these in a user friendly enviroment, so that a regular user could
      handle that.
