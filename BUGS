General (all platforms) known bugs:
-----------------------------------

=== with known solution or workaround:

Bug:
  Desktop viewer (or certain other VT52 activity) touches wrong memory
  which causes ARAnyM to quit unexpectedly.

Reason:
  Something regarding the blitter emulation
  as with NVDI/fVDI installed it does not happen.

Solution:
  Install NVDI or fVDI. And help us debug this issue.

---

Bug:
  PureC cannot open project file on host filesystem.

Reason:
  A MetaDOS related bug in PureC.

Solution:
  Patch your PureC with supplied patch.

---

Bug:
  ARAnyM crashes after start with message:
   "Xlib: async reply ...."

Reason:
  A bug in sdltimer (maybe in lib, maybe in ARAnyM, who knows)

Solution:
  Configure ARAnyM with --disable-sdltimer and recompile.


=== unknown solutions yet:

Videlity Configure Tool does not work. It used to work, though. No idea.


Platform dependent known bugs and limitations:
----------------------------------------------

SDL_Timer works properly on Linux only, it seems. So for most other
platforms (including Windows) you have to configure the build with
--disable-sdltimer.

There are three different FPU emulators in ARAnyM, and only the IEEE
version has full 68040 FPU instruction set. On non-Linux-i386 platforms
the uae FPU emulation is used and so some 68040 specific FPU instructions
are missing. This will be fixed eventually.

MacOS X does not like floating videoram. Compile with --enable-fixedvideoram.
