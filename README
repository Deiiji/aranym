Falcon040 Virtual Machine
-------------------------

If you want to run in window under X11, start aranym without any parameter.
Otherwise start aranym with "-f" for fullscreen (even on console).

If your mouse doesn't work correctly on console you may want to set the
SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2 environment variable to 1 (this is if you have IMPS2 mouse).

export SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2=1; ./aranym
