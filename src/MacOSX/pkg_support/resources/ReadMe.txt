Hi All,

this is ARAnyM 0.8.6beta for MacOSX. ARAnyM is (c) ARAnyM development team
(see AUTHORS) and is distributed under the terms of GPL (see COPYING).

Please read the README and NEWS files in the DOC folder. Some interesting
information you can find also in the BUGS and TODO files.

ARAnyM for MacOSX stores its configuration in the "Documents" folder
in subfolder named "Aranym files" by default. The configuration is plain text file
and you can edit it freely.

Please note that ARAnyM for MacOSX does not support all the great features
of ARAnyM running on Linux (networking, JIT compiler for CPU). This is not 
an intention but rather lack of resources. Our main aim is to build a complete
distribution installable on any computer and running on a Linux kernel so
while we spend a lot of time with debugging this MacOSX version it's not
our primary target.. Check out the AFROS Live CD to see a promising example.

Get the AFROS (Aranym FRee OS) package at ARAnyM web pages. It contains
a preconfigured FreeMiNT plus XaAES plus TeraDesk. HostFS access is also
preconfigured there so you can copy files from/to your Windows disk drives.
