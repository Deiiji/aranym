      The main goal of the project is to create a virtual machine that would allow everyone to
      run current 32bit Atari ST/TT/Falcon applications on their computer regardless if it's
      an IBM clone (read it as "PC" :-), an Apple, an Unix server, a graphics workstation or
      even a portable computer. We modeled the virtual machine after the most advanced Atari
      computer equipped with the latest hardware extensions - that is Falcon030
      with Afterburner040 (bringing the CPU to MC68040) and a graphics card. But we don't
      stop there - the virtual machine will be extended to allow developing new powerful
      TOS/GEM applications and will become the new platform for all current and previous
      Atari users.
      <p/>
      To create the virtual machine we started a project named ARAnyM in early 2001.
      In some three weeks we have been booting to desktop and since then we work
      on configuration, new features etc. There are several active developers right
      now:
        Milan Jurik (working mainly on CPU and portability),
        Standa Opichal of Jay Software fame (working on fVDI and related things),
        Ctirad Fertr (father of the whole idea)
        and Petr Stehlik AKA Joy Software (working on HW emulation and such things).
