- implemented proper Bus Error (hardware.cpp and others). This helps
  in a number of places, namely in FPU detection routines.

- fixed floppy emulation (fdc.cpp). STonX code contained wrong HW register
  addresses. I found it when I enabled FastRAM - the FDC was crashing
  the virtual machine.

- added memory bounds checking (memory.h). Ill behaving programs (and bad FDC
  emulation, as mentioned above :) won't crash the virtual machine anymore!

- new memory allocation (main_unix.cpp), enables 32 MB of FastRAM.
