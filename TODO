Before 0.8.0 release:
---------------------
- get_network_settings --host-ip --atari-ip --netmask --mtu (done)
- host-ip, atari-ip, netmask, mtu in config file
- supermount point of hostfs in config file
- diskimage updating config file automatically
- P4 JIT fix from Basilisk
- major doc update (networking, disk image, afros)

Some hot ideas (before we'll forget them :-)
============================================

Note that the name before a TODO item doesn't mean the item is assigned to
that particular programmer but rather who is the author of the idea :-)

- joy: fix the mouse jumping in fVDI with STOP#$2000 enabled FreeMiNT kernel

- joy: Clipboard sharing between host and atari. Some URLs for inspiration:
  http://www.idata.sk/~robo/mpcb/
  http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt

  Basic idea: C:\CLIPBRD\SCRAP.TXT is copied to CLIPBOARD on X11 host
  and vice-versa (during input focus changes).

  Extra cool idea: PRIMARY selection on X11 could be stored to IKBD buffer
  directly so it would simulate typing.

- joy: [ I just forget it. Oh no. I bet it was something brilliant :-( ]

- joy: printing to file (/dev/lp)

- joy: emulating a serial port compatible with MiNT/HSMODEM

- joy: rewrite all HW modules to make use of BASE_IO::handle_read/write()

- joy: in fdc.cpp: replace HWget_b() and HWput_b() with something more
       appropriate for inter-module communication

- joy: in hardware.cpp: HWget_l/HWput_l should not have the special case
       for HW_IDE. Best would be to implement word and longword HW access
       emulation directly for all modules.

- joy: document the way the aranym works - especially the hardware
       emulation (ARAnyM Hackers Guide).

- joy: document the command line switches, keyboard combos and write Users
       Guide.

- Milan: full revision of CPU/FPU instr. set

- Milan: distributed dispatcher for JIT compiler sigsegv handler

- Milan: gdb as debugger for ARAnyM

- Milan: SIGINT ndebug problem solution

- STanda: hostfs.cpp: enable debug and implement all NOT IMPLEMENTED needed
         methods.
