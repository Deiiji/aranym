These are the first basic tools for Aranym:

- FASTRAM.PRG v2.0 that detects FastRAM size automatically and reserves
  64kB block of RAM for DMA operations to FastRAM (Cookie "_FRB")

- CLOCKY.PRG that write actual mouse position to $f9000e/$f90010
  (It was faster to implement it into Clocky (TM) than to write a new TSR).
  Clocky by default do not alter the keyboard layout now. Get full
  Clocky 3.0 distribution at http://joy.atari.org/ - there's a nice editor
  of keyboard layout.

Soon there will be a tool for arafs that will edit the
MetaDOS' config.sys file automatically.

Finally all these tools will be merged into one AraKit.
