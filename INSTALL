You have to have SDL 1.2.x, get it from http://www.libsdl.org/
or from your distribution vendor.

If you run a flavor of Unix or Linux, go to src/Unix folder.

If you got the source code from CVS then type
./autogen.sh && make

otherwise type ./configure && make

If everything went OK you got an executable file named "aranym".
Either install it with 'make install' (root privileges expected)
or run it directly by typing ./aranym.

It's a good idea to edit the config file ~/.aranymrc, an example you'll
find in doc/src/atari/aranymrc.example.

More information will follow soon.
