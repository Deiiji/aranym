2001/11/01
==========

 Mouse behavior fixed:
  1) you can release mouse grab by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Esc (VMware compatible)
  2) you can grab mouse by click the left mouse button (VMware compatible)
  3) if the Atari mouse driver is active, you can release mouse by moving
     the mouse off the window and by moving back you grab it again. This
     can be disabled by setting "AutoGrabMouse=No" in the config file.

 You can save the config file by 'aranym -s' (or --save). This is useful
 if you want to see newly added options. You can also choose a different
 config file by 'aranym -c /path/to/different/aranymrc'. This even works
 together: 'aranym -c /tmp/aranymrc.example -s' will create a fresh config
 file in /tmp with all default values.
