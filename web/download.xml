      Please note that ARAnyM is not finished yet. It's a work in progress and the current
      status is somewhere between alpha and beta. It may work but we can't guarantee 
      anything. Better backup your data first.
      <p/>
      Regular releases (source, binary and disk images) are located
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41106">here</a>.
      Please note that while we may provide a binary of Aranym for Windows it's not
      supported as the main development runs on Linux. The Windows version has some severe
      limitations so do not judge the Aranym by looking at the Windows port, please.
      <p/>
      Debian users can fetch ARAnyM with apt from Debian Sid distribution. See 
      <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/otherosfs/aranym.html">ARAnyM page in Debian</a>.
      <p/>
      Most up-to-date source code is available in the <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>. You need
      to have autoconf installed for compiling the CVS source code.
      <p/>
      Nightly CVS snapshot (generated at 01:00 GMT) is <a href="http://atari.sh.cvut.cz/ftp/other/snapshot.tar.gz">here</a>. The configure script is pre-generated in this tar file so you
      don't need the autoconf.
      <p/>
      For running ARAnyM you will also need TOS 4.04 from Falcon (available <a href="http://www.atariroms.fsnet.co.uk/">here</a>) or EmuTOS (there is a binary image for Falcon so get that one <a href="http://emutos.sf.net/">here</a>).
