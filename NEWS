2005/04/14 - version 0.9.0 release

 We've been providing 68040 PMMU (a memory management unit emulation,
 required for running FreeMiNT with MMU protection, and Linux/m68k)
 since version 0.1.5 (almost three years ago) though this is the first
 version of ARAnyM where the PMMU really works, thanks to awesome
 debugging and fixing done by Andreas Schwab.

 So ARAnyM runs Linux/m68k kernel now. Really. This opens up a new
 area of usage - ARAnyM can help developing Linux/m68k kernel and
 systems based on it (Debian/m68k, for example).

 Besides the PMMU there is a whole lot of new features and fixes:

 o multisession CD in IDE emulation
 o Win32 networking (TAP based, like in Linux)
 o NFOSMESA: OpenGL rendering for Atari applications using host CPU
 o NFJPEG: JPEG decoder (a TSR) using host CPU power via NatFeats, based
   on Brainstorm's JPEG DSP decoder API
 o direct disk partitions access
 o MFP interrupts fixed
 o LILO fixes, compiles without linux headers now
 o many 64-bit fixes and cleanups
 o compiling using the Fink suite on MacOSX
 o famous fVDI boot bug fixed
 o fVDI fixes in bitplanes
 o parallel port mapped to parport (in linux) or to a file
 o hotkeys configuration: Setup, Quit, Reboot, Ungrab, Debugger, ScreenShot
   and FullScreen hotkeys can be configured at runtime in the SETUP.
 o SETUP fileselector improved (folders before files, CWD)
 o fVDI pixel size bug fixed
 o documentation.txt updated with several new sections (networking,
   programming with ARAnyM, single partitions support and more).


2004/11/07 - version 0.8.11beta released

 We've been slow and quiet lately but nevertheless a progress has been
 made. Some important changes for users include:

 o FASTRAM.PRG is no longer needed. Xavier patched TOS 4.04 so it now
   finds out the correct FastRAM size automagically.

 o Bridged networking works and is easy to set up thanks to the updated
   'arabridge' script and slightly improved documentation.txt.
   You must update your 'aranym.xif' FreeMiNT driver (now requires
   FreeMiNT 1.16.0 or newer) and also the nfeth-config tool.

 o JIT compiler in Windows binary works better than in previous release.

 o integrated LILO fixed (though ARAnyM does not boot Linux-m68k yet).

 o various little SETUP GUI improvements (edit fields are much better now,
   CHS values are updated correctly after creating new empty disk image,
   repeated saving of config file from the SETUP GUI fixed, new Keyboard
   and mouse setup dialog - almost empty now, but promising :-).

 o AutoZoom screen fixed and improved. You can now choose a constant host
   screen size for whatever the Atari screen size is. Might be very useful
   for LCD/DFP owners. This improvements required change in the API and so
   new version of 'aranym.sys' fVDI ARAnyM screen driver must be installed
   in your setup.

 o Mac users might enjoy new keyboard translation tables. All keys should
   be mapped correctly.

 o new EmuTOS included in this release fixes XaAES/FreeMiNT 1.16.1beta
   keyboard problems.

 o host mouse wheel can produce Eiffel 1.08+ compatible scancodes now.
   Switch this mode in the SETUP GUI. Note that currently neither fVDI
   nor EmuTOS support this.

 All beta testers (i.e. YOU :-) are encouraged to report all bugs
 and problems either into aranym user mailing list or directly into
 the bug tracker (available on ARAnyM webpages under the 'Contact' link).


2004/08/07 - version 0.8.10beta released

 Great news for MS Windows users: ARAnyM runs with JIT CPU compiler now
 thanks to Xavier's work on sigsegv handler.

 Other than that we have been fixing bugs and cleaning the source code:

 o Francois fixed sinh and tanh (FPU instructions)
 o 'aratapif' is found in $PATH again
 o many more internal bug fixes that are not directly visible to users


2004/07/06 - version 0.8.9beta released

 Great bug fixes:

 o JIT CPU is working on Linux 2.6.x
 o Blitter is finally not crashing anymore
 o integrated LILO (Linux Loader) reads gzipped files
 o SDL GUI now accepts numbers typed on numpad

 Especially the Blitter fix itself justifies a new release
 since it has always been buggy and it was so annoying. Now we've won.


2004/07/05 - version 0.8.8beta released

 Main bug fixes:

 o MC68881 tan() insn fixed on ia-32 host cpu arch
 o one of JIT SIGSEGV crashes on linux 2.6.x
 o floppy emulation (corrupted in 0.8.6beta release)
 o HostFS fixes (symlinks, Dfree)
 o many MACOSX fixes (FPU works) and improvements
 o CapsLock under X11 fixed
 o various SDL GUI bugfixes

 New features:

 o new networking based on bridging:
   tools/arabridge is able to establish a bridge over the tap0 tunnel
   and eth0 nif so that aranym becomes part of your LAN visible from
   other machines etc. For example DHCP from ARAnyM works now.
   [ETH0] type = ppp|bridge and tunnel = tap0 config options added
 
 o Patrice's experimental PCI bridge (disabled in default builds), can
   be used for developing PCI drivers for Milan/Hades on ARAnyM :-)
 
 o SETUP GUI visually improved again (3D Look! :)

 o easy Disk Image generation in the SETUP - just enter your desired disk
   image path and size in MB and click on Generate.

 o configuration file parser now recognizes "~" special char that is
   expanded to $HOME (path to user home dir).


2004/02/15 - version 0.8.7beta released
==========

 o fixing HostFS bug that was introduced in 0.8.6beta
 o further visual improvements of SETUP GUI
 o better handling of Reset/Restart of an operating system


2004/02/08 - version 0.8.6beta released
==========

Important bugfixes, further SETUP improvements and new Mac OSX target:

 o visual improvements in SETUP GUI
 o new functions available in SETUP GUI (Fullscreen, ScreenShots, Help)
 o fixed changing path to Floppy in the SETUP
 o fixed serious bug in Floppy path configuration (crash at startup)
 o fixed serious bug in NVRAM handling (might caused crashes at early TOS boot)
 o hopefully fixed problem with HostFS mount points on aranym reboot


2004/01/07 - version 0.8.5beta released
==========

Number of important changes:

 o JIT CPU fixed! (although kernel 2.6 is not supported yet)
 o double bus errors (infamous error loops) handled now correctly
 o direct Mac OS X support for ARAnyM (compiles but doesn't run(?))
 o HostFS fixed
 o script for easy building of ARAnyM on Windows/cygwin 
 o SETUP GUI greatly improved - Disks Setup is complete, other will follow
 o SETUP GUI at startup of ARAnyM (-G command line switch)
 o floppy insert/eject support at runtime (in the SETUP GUI)
 o fVDI NatFeat driver with local color palette support (XaAES likes it)
   You will have to update your fVDI driver.
 o ARAnyM now defines new value for the _MCH cookie: 0x50000. Update
   your .aranym/config files with this new value.
 o Alt+Ctrl+Esc now helps releasing mouse&kbd input even in fullscreen

 New AFROS is released together with ARAnyM to provide the updated
 fVDI driver.

 Generally most work went into the SDL GUI SETUP which is becoming
 a central place for on-the-fly reconfiguration. Press the "Pause"
 key to open up the SETUP GUI anytime. Currently only disk configuration
 is complete but new setup dialogs will follow shortly.


2003/10/04 - version 0.8.2beta released
==========

Changes:

 o Direct Linux-m68k loading with integrated LILO
 o MIDI output to a file
 o HostFS cleaned up again (you must upgrade your HOSTFS.DOS driver)
 o SCSI emulation introduced which simplifies the harddisk driver
   installation greatly
 o STOP CPU instruction fixed to work properly (no more shaky
   mouse under EmuTOS and FreeMiNT)
 o Native access to host's CD/DVD-ROM using BetaDOS BOS NatFeat CDROM driver
 o Various little updates in README, FAQ and doc/documentation.txt
 o Literally tons of bugfixes and improvements (fVDI, JIT, XHDI, portability)


2003/04/11 - version 0.8.0beta3 released
==========

Changes:

 o Windows/Cygwin support greatly improved (see below)
 o HostFS bugfixed and works equally well on Windows/Cygwin

 Binaries released for Windows/Cygwin now define clearly where ARAnyM
 files are stored: User-specific files (configuration, NVRAM) are in
 subfolder ".aranym" in the My Documents folder (usually available from
 your desktop directly).  System-wide data (TOS, EmuTOS, font8.bmp) are
 stored in subfolder "aranym" relative to the aranym.exe binary.


2003/04/08 - version 0.8.0beta2 released
==========

Changes:

 o the key for making a screenshot changed to PrintScreen
 o [ARANYMFS] renamed to [HOSTFS]
 o aratapif execution fixed
 o HostFS improved
 o Cygwin support should be better

 For updating your ARAnyM config file simply run "aranym -s".


2003/03/23 - version 0.8.0beta1 released
==========

New features:

 o Networking. Yeah! ARAnyM.XIF as the Ethernet driver for MiNT-Net.
 o VIDEL compatible (bitplane) 1, 2, 4 and 8 bit fVDI modes.
 o new command line option "--swap-ide" that allows you to boot from [IDE1]
 o new HostFS drivers (both BetaDOS and MiNT's xfs) are fully working now.
 o for GFA programmers out there: natfeat/atari_example_gfa.lst
 o new config option "ModelName" for [IDE0/1]. Name your drives :-)
 o P4 fix for JIT (thanks to Gwenole of Basilisk II)
 o CD-ROM now also on Windows/Cygwin

 Naturally some bugs were fixed - most notably in mouse input.

 Also we've received some BeOS related patches so ARAnyM might run on BeOS
 as well now.


2003/01/29 - version 0.7.0 released
==========

What is new?

 NatFeats seem to finally stabilize. "__NF" cookie has been hardwired
 both to TOS 4.04 and to EmuTOS so it can be used by user applications
 to test for extended host capabilities. See the example code in
 src/natfeat/atari_example.c.

 Improved VIDEL emulation (virtual screens work now). Improved VIDEL
 rendering including auto zooming and OpenGL render.

 fVDI fixed. You must update your floppy/disk images with new fVDI driver.

 New experimental hostfs access drivers - instead of using MetaDOS driver
 under FreeMiNT Standa created a proper FreeMiNT XFS driver and then wrote
 a FreeMiNT API emulation layer for singleTOS' MetaDOS! This is untested
 so beware and backup your data first.

 Also more work has been done on ECE (Ethernet Card Emulation). It's
 unfinished, though - currently the MiNT driver throws bombs. We would
 need some Atari hackers to debug some of the Atari driver peculiarities.

 Large disks (disk images) supported now. There is also a new tool
 for creating real large disk images (up to 32 GB!)

 And as always, many bugfixes.

 I also put together a first snapshot of the "afros" (ARAnyM FRee OS" :-)
 Just download it, unpack it and run aranym with the provided config file.


2002/10/20 - version 0.6.8 released
==========

 Highlights:
 - aranym on Mac OS X really works
 - aranym can open read only disk drives or images (designed for aranym on CD)
 - CD-ROM works like on real Atari (auto mount)
 - GFA Basic works thanks to IKBD fix

 Finally an active Mac OS X user cared to send us a few mails so Mac OS X
 is now fully working and a binary package of aranym for Mac OS X will soon
 be available. Thanks Wim!

 The new option for read only disk drives has been extended so it's not
 XHDI specific anymore but works generally also for emulated IDE interface.
 Thus change your aranym config file - the XhdiWrite is replaced with
 ReadOnly flag.
 
 [IDE0|1]
 # XhdiWrite = Yes|No 		; default is No, enable for EmuTOS
 ReadOnly = Yes|No          ; default is No, change to Yes if you want
                            ; to open read only disk image (e.g. from a CD)

 Many various changes to JIT compiler (TuneAlignment, NOP filler and more).
 Several JIT related statistics are enabled in this build.

 CD-ROM support was greatly improved. CD Automount works like on real Atari,
 you just insert a CD and access it. For unmounting a CD you can either use
 various software utilities (try Ctrl+Shift+J in Thing!) or you can also
 use the aranym GUI - you'll find there new section "Discs" and in that 
 a CD-ROM button labelled either "Eject" or "Insert" (depends on the current
 CD-ROM status).

 Also an interesting fix in IKBD now allows GFA Basic (3.6TT) to run on
 Aranym (even under EmuTOS :)

 Some cosmetics changes - documentation updated mildly, aranym now prints
 its version on startup (include in your debug reports), some clean ups
 in the source code for better portability (non-c-headers support, generic
 bool..).


2002/10/12 - version 0.6.6 released
==========

 This release brings a couple of major changes. Probably the greatest is
 that the JIT (just-in-time) compiler of m68k code into x86 code works
 and makes ARAnyM the fastest Atari clone ever made. Now you can do things
 you never thought that would be possible - like watching fullscreen DivX
 movies or playing famous games like Quake. It's real fast.

 Another cool thing is the Native Features interface, designed to allow
 writing video/sound/disk drivers and other extensions in a portable way.
 First thing that got ported to NatFeat interface is the XHDI extension
 that lets EmuTOS access the ARAnyM disk drives directly. Other drivers
 will be ported to NatFeats soon. Look at src/natfeat/atari_example.c
 to see how easy is to write a NatFeat compliant driver.

 Surprising news is the DSP M56001 emulation that was added by Patrice.
 See what he has to say about it: "I only got one DSP program to work:
 a very simple rotozoom one I wrote. There are many things missing
 in the DSP emulation: interrupts, audio. The only programs that could
 work are those that use the DSP for calculations (and read/write their
 parameters on the host port). BadMood is in this case. You can also use
 the Motorola DSP tools to build DSP programs under Aranym, they work."

 Patrice also rewrote the IKBD/MIDI/ACIA implementation and ARAnyM now
 supports also joysticks. And improved VIDEL by adding auto center and
 auto zoom features (small Atari resolution should be zoomed automatically).

 New config options in aranym config file are as follows:

 [JIT]
 JIT = Yes|No
 JITFPU = Yes|No
 JITCacheSize = <amount_in_kB>	// cache size - bigger = better
 JITLazyFlush = <number>

 [IDE0|1]
 XhdiWrite = Yes|No 			// default is No, enable for EmuTOS

 Also, ndebug was improved. Breakpoints were added and also
 "run until <addr_in_memory> = <certain_value>" was implemented.

 fVDI blitting is faster now up to 4 times. Also, you have to update both
 fVDI.PRG and aranym.sys fVDI driver on your disk images. Don't forget that!

 For other fixes and changes please look into the ChangeLog file. Thanks.

2002/07/20 - version 0.2.0 released (celebrating the Woody release!)
==========

 Long time since previous release. I have been waiting for finishing
 a couple of promising modules but since Debian 3.0 (AKA Woody) has just
 been released I am releasing ARAnyM as well to celebrate it :-)
 Seriously, we wanted to give you something to play with and test the
 number of changes and new features in ARAnyM while we'll be working
 towards next major release.

 Major news:

   - new graphical user interface for runtime configuration of ARAnyM
     (unfinished yet)

   - EmuTOS being part of ARAnyM binary distribution (TOS 4.04 is not
     required to boot ARAnyM anymore)

   - boot floppy image with essential up-to-date ARAnyM drivers and tools
     (so you can easily upgrade your harddisk images)

 And now more detailed news in ARAnyM since last public release:

 Standa created 'fvdicout.app' which, being based on TosWin II source code
 should bring a complete VT52 emulation for applications with console
 output under fVDI. You'll find it in atari/fvdi/utility folder.

 Heiko Achilles added a 'mouse packet compressor' that is supposed to
 remove any delay when moving with mouse more quickly (or on more loaded
 machine). It may either fix problems you could have with your mouse
 or it can create a new, previously unseen mouse events' bugs. Test
 and let us know.

 The aranymfs (the MetaDOS host filesystem driver) has been converted
 to GCC compilable form. Please beware and test the host filesystem access
 carefully.

 Brand new keyboard hotkeys:

 - Scroll Lock (the mostly unused key on PC keyboards) now switches
   between windowed and fullscreen mode!

 - Ctrl+Pause cold reboots the ARAnyM correctly now

 - Pause key now invokes cool new ARAnyM GUI configuration.

 Please note that the GUI is far from being finished. The only useful
 option is the "Reset" and perhaps also the Quit (for those that can't
 remember the Shift+Pause combo). The GUI will soon be filled with tons
 of configure options so stay tuned...

 Another change from previous versions is that we now require original
 TOS 4.04. Various patched versions we supported before are unsupported
 now. So please get a clean original TOS 4.04 - or give the EmuTOS a try!
 All you need is to empty the "TOS=" option in the ARAnyM config file.

 Long filename->TOS 8.3 format conversion was improved so that it now
 handles also filenames ending with a dot.

 A long standing bug in Yamaha emulation was fixed. This helps mainly
 the lowlevel emulation of parallel port access. The parallel/printer
 port is emulated so accurately that even PARCP works flawlessly.
 Note though that this is not enabled automatically as it requires
 root privileges to run ARAnyM. We are going to add other methods
 for accessing the host parallel port in a more user/kernel friendly
 way.

 I know that after releasing the input focus with Alt+Ctrl+Esc combo
 sometimes the Alt+Ctrl stay held down. I added a special code for 
 removing the stale Alt+Ctrl state. Please let us know if this helped.

 Hackers Guide (hguide.txt) was updated. If you want to hack on ARAnyM
 you should read it first.

 From the other exciting news: Patrice Mandin has started work on DSP
 emulation for ARAnyM. He's actually nearly finished it so it may be
 available in the next version of ARAnyM already!

 Johan Klockars also started rewriting some pretty core things in the
 fVDI ARAnyM driver and fVDI itself so expect the next major release
 to be a real killer (in both good and bad sense ;-)

 BTW, if there is a developer that would be willing to finish the nearly
 working ECE (Ethernet Card Emulation) then please join us in ARAnyM
 development mailing list.

 Generally, there is a lot of cool things to work on in ARAnyM project
 so if you want to help out then write to us.


2002/04/22 - version 0.1.7 released
==========

 Sound is working! Put the atari/sound/zmagxsnd.prg to your AUTO
 folder and Aniplayer (after switching to XBIOS in its Sound Config
 dialog) should play all sounds nicely!

 Several very bad or annoying bugs in aranymfs fixed. Now it should
 be real usable.

 It's possible to Reboot the machine by pressing Ctrl+Pause.
 IKBD problems after reboot will be fixed in next release.

 Two new config file options: "Redir_Console" and "Redit_Printer".
 If set to "yes" the BIOS console (2 and 5) or printer (0) output
 is redirected to the host console.

 RPM spec file for ARAnyM. If your Linux distro is RPM based you may want
 to try out the following command:
    'rpm -tb aranym-0.1.7.tar.gz'
 It should build a binary RPM package of aranym which you can then install
 the usual way (rpm -i aranym*.rpm).


2002/04/12 - version 0.1.6 released
==========

 Serious problem with NMI not being able to break STOPped CPU
 fixed. Also when compiled with --disable-timer it now generates
 system 200 Hz interrupt correctly even when the CPU is STOPped.


2002/04/11 - version 0.1.5 released (please update your fVDI driver!)
==========

 Since the previous public release we made a lot of changes. Probably the most
 significant is the large rewrite of CPU. Current ARAnyM can be compiled
 with full PMMU (Memory Management Unit of Motorola 68040 CPU). This brings
 the ability to run FreeMiNT with memory protection enabled. It also opens
 door for running Unix-like operating systems (Linux or NetBSD for m68k)
 but unfortunately the current level of HW emulation is not sufficient for
 those yet. But we are working on it (and gladly accept any help from you!)

 While rewriting the CPU we also updated the FPU. ARAnyM's FPU now fully
 supports all MC68881/2 as well as MC86040 FPU instructions.
 
 There is also a developer version of ARAnyM with JIT (just-in-time compiler)
 but it is not stable enough yet.

 SGI/Irix is yet another supported host platform and we have added preliminary
 support for MiNT as the host platform ;-)

 On most supported host platforms the memory access was accelerated (thus
 the overall speed of ARAnyM increased).

 ARAnyM is the first Atari compatible platform with support for the native
 instruction interface (Native Features). That will bring new possibilities
 for next generation Atari software.

 AranymFS - our system clean MetaDOS driver for accessing host filesystem
 was greatly bugfixed. During debugging of this some Atari software proven
 to be ill-designed (such as PureC IDE - it is unable to cope with files
 on MetaDOS drives due to misusing certain range of GEMDOS handles. We
 developed a patch for it so now you can enjoy compiling with PureC on
 host filesystem). Besides that, there is a beta version of AranymFS.XFS
 driver for MiNT!

 The other improvements include new IDE emulation (including ATAPI CD-ROM,
 try e.g. ejecting the CD from within Thing desktop), new config file
 is created with correct default values, and many other fixes.

 Note that due to changes in fVDI host driver you need to update your
 fVDI Atari driver - there is a precompiled fvdi.sys in "atari/fvdi/drivers".
 Also you might want to update the AranymFS driver for MetaDOS/BetaDOS:
 it's also available as a precompiled binary in "atari/aranymfs/" folder.

 Last note: printing to Atari parallel port is now redirected to the console
 where you started ARAnyM from... This is not the final solution but rather
 a little hack that can be used for debug prints.


2002/02/12 - version 0.0.21 released
==========

 ARAnyM has a new version of IDE emulation. It should work on more
 platforms (*BSD, for example).

 Generally the portability is better (fixes also in ndebug and aranymfs).

 There is a new untested alpha version of aranym.xfs for MiNT.

 And we have a new long detailed users guide in documentation.txt file.


2002/01/28 - version 0.0.20 released
==========

 ARAnyM is at least +33% faster than the previous release. We greatly
 optimized the CPU memory access time and also interrupt emulation.

 ARAnyM runs with the SDL TimerThread by default again. This gives us
 more flexibility (see the STOP insn below) and is necessary for
 the upcoming JIT CPU (just-in-time compilation of m68k code).

 ARAnyM supports STOP instruction that put the CPU to sleep. This works
 perfectly in latest EmuTOS (CVS version). ARAnyM does not eat CPU
 cycles when the EmuTOS is idle.

 ARAnyM configuration file changed its location and got more options:
 all ARAnyM user files are now located in $HOME/.aranym/ folder.
 The configuration file is named "config" (thus the complete path is
 $HOME/.aranym/config). The configuration file is created automatically
 if it is not found. The old $HOME/.aranymrc is not read, you have to
 update your new config file by hand.

 New noteworthy command line options include "--refresh <x>" where you
 can specify the VIDEL refresh.

 ARAnyM now contains special support for native harddrive access from
 EmuTOS. This allows EmuTOS to actually boot from a harddrive attached
 to ARAnyM machine.

 Many many fixes - in floppy (formatting works), fVDI driver (colors after
 resolution change), NVRAM (year 2002 not 2001), MFP (TimerC) and more.

 Great thing for all Debian users - ARAnyM is now included in Debian Sid
 distribution.

 Last but not least - ARAnyM runs under Windows as well. You can compile
 the released source code with Cygwin to get Windows executable.

 Look into ChangeLog for more details.


2001/12/06 - version 0.0.11 released
==========
 The keyboard emulation in aranym has been rewritten and is based on pure
 scancodes now. Thanks to that the original TOS kbd tables should work on
 regular PC keyboards (at least English/USA works perfectly). You should be
 able to use any NVRAM configuration tool to switch your TOS kbd layout
 nationality from USA (now default) to any other of the six(teen) defined.
 Don't forget to update the Clocky.prg (current version available in
 src/atari/tools/ does not alter the original TOS keyboard by default).

 Previously there were errors when reading floppies with FastRAM enabled.
 Use the latest FastRAM v2.0 (available in src/atari/tools) and floppies
 will be OK - well, apart from those large floppies (4 MB and more) from
 STonX. These are NOT VALID floppies but rather single partitions of
 a harddrive. ARAnyM will handle them when we implement XHDI emulation.

 IKBD emulation was fixed so that Videlity config program works now. Videlity
 is a Falcon screen enhancer (freeware). Get it and enjoy Videl at 1024x768 :)

 fVDI was greatly improved so you might not need to play with Videlity at all.
 Use the new aranym.sys driver available in src/atari/fvdi/drivers/ and also
 the new fVDI.prg itself (src/atari/fvdi/).

 The patches for TOS 4.04 were cleaned up a lot. If you were using
 a prepatched TOS version please delete it and get the original TOS 4.04.

 IDE emulation was fixed so that formatting and partitioning of ext2 by
 a MiNT installer work now properly.

 Various bugfixes were done including ndebug, aranymfs, MMU040, command line
 parameters and more.

 If you want to debug aranym itself (in gdb) or to debug something inside
 of aranym using the internal debugger then you might want to disable the
 mouse grabbing completely: simply run aranym --nomouse (or -N).

 Last but not least - ARAnyM has been successfully ported to Solaris (with
 help of Francois LE COAT) and Windows/cygwin (thanks to Olivier Landemarre).


2001/11/06
==========
 The TOS patch we used included WinX by a mistake. That's been removed.
 Now you'll need to install real GEMRAM and also WinX to your auto folder
 if you wish to use the WinX AES enhancements. Please note that the
 GEMRAM 1.0 from the Aratools does not work. It actually didn't work for
 a long time. Use the real GEMRAM (that copies ROM to RAM) instead if you
 want to use WinX.


2001/11/01
==========

 Mouse behavior fixed:
  1) you can release mouse grab by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Esc (VMware compatible)
  2) you can grab mouse by click the left mouse button (VMware compatible)
  3) if the Atari mouse driver is active, you can release mouse by moving
     the mouse off the window and by moving back you grab it again. This
     can be disabled by setting "AutoGrabMouse=No" in the config file.

 You can save the config file by 'aranym -s' (or --save). This is useful
 if you want to see newly added options. You can also choose a different
 config file by 'aranym -c /path/to/different/aranymrc'. This even works
