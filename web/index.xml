      The main goal of the project is to create a virtual machine that would allow everyone to
      run current 32bit Atari ST/TT/Falcon applications on their computer regardless if it's
      an IBM clone (read it as "PC" :-), an Apple, an Unix server, a graphics workstation or
      even a portable computer.
      <p/>
      We modeled the virtual machine after the most advanced Atari
      computer equipped with the latest hardware extensions - that is Falcon030
      with Afterburner040 (bringing the CPU to MC68040) and a graphics card. But we didn't
      stop there - the virtual machine will be extended to allow developing new powerful
      TOS/GEM applications and will become the new platform for all current and previous
      Atari users.
      <p/>
      To create the virtual machine we started a project named ARAnyM in early 2001.
      In some three weeks we have been booting to desktop and since then we work
      on configuration, new drivers and ports to other operating systems etc.
