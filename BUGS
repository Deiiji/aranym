  as with NVDI/fVDI installed it does not happen.

  PureC cannot open project file on host filesystem.

Reason:
  A MetaDOS related bug in PureC.

Solution:
  Patch your PureC with supplied patch.

=== unknown solutions yet:

Videlity Configure Tool does not work. It used to work, though. No idea.


Platform dependent known bugs and limitations:
----------------------------------------------

There are three different FPU emulators in ARAnyM, and only the IEEE
version has full 68040 FPU instruction set. On non-Linux-i386 platforms
the uae FPU emulation is used and so some 68040 specific FPU instructions
are missing. This will be fixed eventually.

MacOS X does not like floating videoram. Compile with --enable-fixedvideoram.
