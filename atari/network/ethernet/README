aranym.xif
==========

The xif interface for the eth0 interface for MiNT-Net.

Installation and usage
----------------------
Install MiNT-Net and copy the aranym.xif into your mint folder.
Then configure the eth0 interface - please note that the IP addresses are
currently hardcoded in the ARAnyM source code (XIF_ATARI_IP and XIF_HOST_IP
in aranym/src/natfeat/ece.cpp):

mint:~# ifconfig eth0 addr 192.168.0.2 up
mint:~# route add default eth0 gw 192.168.0.1

Then in MiNT-Net you can e.g. ping to 192.168.0.1 (which is a host side
of the TAP tunnel).

IMPORTANT: ATM aranym need to be run as a root to get the TAP
          interface else some error messages will be printed like these:
--- begin --
ECE: init
ECE: if opened tap0

HHC894I Error setting MTU for tap0: Operation not permitted
HHC897I Error setting driving system IP addr for tap0: Permission denied
HHC897I Error setting Hercules IP addr for tap0: Permission denied
HHC897I Error setting netmask for tap0: Permission denied
HHC899I Error setting flags for tap0: Permission denied
initTap failure
--- end ---


How it works
------------

The ARAnyM establishes the TAP interface (using tuntap driver).
tuntap linux driver: /usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt

Compilation
-----------
 * to compile the xif you need the source tree of FreeMiNT 1.16 (use
   CVS head branch) and if compiling on host, don't forget to edit
   the CONFIGVARS and enable the CROSS=yes there. Point the
   FREEMINT_SRC_HOME environment variable to its home (the
   COPYING.MiNT file is there).
 * use make.sh to compile
 * the binaries are placed into the .bin subfolder

 ARAnyM binary:
 * run configure with --enable-ethernet
