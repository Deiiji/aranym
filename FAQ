Question:

  I would like to contribute to the development. I wanted to use CVS but
  it's read only. What can I do?

Answer:

  Create a diff file using the following command:

    "cvs diff -u >cvsdiff.txt"

  Then mail the cvsdiff.txt to pstehlik@sophics.cz.

Question:
  I copied my mint setup on Aranym. It may works if I can use
  long file names and access rights. Should I use a new disk
  image for that ? How would I build one?

Answer:
  if you have a working setup on Atari and want to have the same
  on Aranym, follow these steps:

1) if you want to boot from the disk, reconfigure your harddisk driver:

   - if you are using HDDRIVER, use HDDRUTIL to disable SCSI bus scan
     (i.e. disable all SCSI devices)

   - if you are using Cecile, you don't have to do anything (Ctirad?)

   - if you are using anything else, cross your fingers (Ctirad?)

2) if you want to use the disk directly, simply take it from your
   Atari machine and put it to your host machine (be it PC, Mac or
   whatever, we don't care). Set up the drive in ./aranymrc, e.g.

   [IDE0]
   Present = Yes
   Path = /dev/hdc
   Cylinders = 2100
   Heads = 16
   SectorsPerTrack = 63
   ByteSwap = No

   The Path point to the physical device. /dev/hdc is master on
   secondary IDE channel (ask someone if you don't know what I am
   talking about).

   The Cylinders/Heads/SectorsPerTrack values maybe either written on
   the disk label or in your hard drive utility (e.g. HDDRUTIL) - but
   only if it's an IDE drive. Aranym also tries to guess the values,
   if you set one from these values to -1 (supported only for real
   devices, only under Linux today).

3) if you want to leave your original disk in your original Atari and
   use just a copy of that disk then create a disk image:

   On Atari you can use anything that allows you to store the whole disk
   drive into one file - e.g. Diskus. Naturally you need a second
   harddrive with more free space than is the size of your disk you are
   creating the image of). Then you have to copy the image to the host
   somehow.

   On the host (PC, Mac, ...), in Unix like OS you can create the disk
   image with as simple command as:

   dd if=/dev/hdc of=/home/aranym/disk_image bs=1M

   For windows you may want to try out a "WinImage" (use download.com?)
   
   For configuring Aranym see the 2) above, just the Path now points to
   the /home/aranym/disk_image.

   Note: if the image has been created on Atari, you have to set the
   ByteSwap IDE Aranym option to "Yes".

4) start aranym and enjoy. Everything should work as expected. However,
   if you were using some special HW drivers, like e.g. Afterburner,
   Centurbo or NOVA/Rage gfx card drivers, you want to disable them.
   So try the first boot with Ctrl held down (AUTO folder programs are
   not executed then).

5) don't forget to reconfigure your harddisk driver on the original
   Atari (see the point 1) back to your favorite values.

Question:
  Is it possible to have CDRom under Aranym, how can I do?

Answer:
  Edit your .aranymrc:

    [IDE1]
    Present = Yes
    IsCDROM = Yes
    Path = /dev/cdrom

  And then set up your Atari environment like you would did on a real Atari
  with IDE CD-ROM attached. E.g. I used CD-Tools' driver and MetaDOS.

Question:
  The GEMBench Blitting test crashes/hangs every time I run it using fVDI.

Answer:
  Put the following line into your FVDI.SYS:

    xbiosfix

  GEMBench is not really good benchmark program for ARAnyM anyway.
