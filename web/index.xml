      The main goal of the project is to create a virtual machine that would allow everyone to install,
      use and also <B>develop new</B> 32bit Atari ST/TT/Falcon applications on their computer
      regardless if it's an IBM clone, an Apple, an Unix server, a graphics workstation or even a portable computer. We modeled the virtual machine after the most advanced Atari computer equipped with the latest hardware extensions - that is Falcon030 with Afterburner040 (upgrading the CPU to MC68040) and a graphics card.
      <p/>
      To create the Falcon040 Virtual Machine (also known as Virtual AfterBurner040) we started a project named ARAnyM in early 2001. In a three weeks we had booted to desktop and since then we work on configuration, new features etc. There are several active developers right now: Milan Jurik (working mainly on CPU and portability), Standa Opichal of Jay Software fame (working on fVDI and related things), Ctirad Fertr (father of the whole idea) and Petr Stehlik AKA Joy Software (working on HW emulation).
