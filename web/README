1) Start the saxon server in the background using the following command:

   ./build/saxonserver &

   Please note:

     For compiling the ARAnyM HTML presentation you need the "saxon.jar" file.
     The saxonserver should download it automatically from ftp.sophics.cz.
     If it fails, you may get it from http://saxon.sf.net/.
     Place it into the build folder.

2) Compile the xml files to html using the following command:

   make

3) You'll find the resulting HTML files in the "out" folder.
