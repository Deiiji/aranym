1) For compiling the ARAnyM HTML presentation you need the "saxon.jar" file.
   You may get it from http://saxon.sf.net/. Place it into the build folder.

2) Go to the build folder and run the saxon server in the background using
   the following commands:

   cd build
   ./saxonserver &

3) Go back to the parent folder and compile the xml files to html:

   cd ..
   make

4) You'll find the output in the "out" folder.
