      Please note that ARAnyM is not finished yet. It's a work-in-progress and
      the current status is about beta quality software. It may work (it does
      work for us) but we can't guarantee anything. Better backup your
      valuable data first.
      <p/>
      Regular releases (source, binary and disk images) are located
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41106">here</a>.
      Please note that while we may provide a binary of Aranym for Windows it's not
      supported as the main development runs on Linux. The Windows version has some severe
      limitations so do not judge the Aranym by looking at the Windows port, please.
      <p/>
      Debian users can fetch ARAnyM with apt from Debian distribution. See 
      <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/otherosfs/aranym.html">ARAnyM page in Debian</a>.
      <p/>
      Most up-to-date source code is available in the <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>. You need
      to have autoconf installed for compiling the CVS source code.
      <p/>
      Nightly CVS snapshot (generated at 02:00 CEST) is <a href="http://atari.sh.cvut.cz/ftp/other/snapshot.tar.gz">here</a>. The configure script is pre-generated in this tar file so you
      don't need the autoconf.
      <p/>
      For running ARAnyM you may want to get the TOS 4.04 image from Falcon (available <a href="http://www.atariroms.fsnet.co.uk/">here</a>). The TOS ROM is not
      part of this archive because it is copyrighted. However we included free
      (GPL) TOS replacement called EmuTOS (<a href="http://emutos.sf.net/">http://emutos.sourceforge.net/</a>).
