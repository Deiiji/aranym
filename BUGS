General (all platforms) known bugs:
-----------------------------------

Bug:
  Desktop viewer (or certain other VT52 activity) touches wrong memory
  which causes ARAnyM to quit unexpectedly.

Reason:
  Something regarding the blitter emulation
  as with NVDI/fVDI installed it does not happen.

---

Bug:
  PureC cannot open project file on host filesystem.

Reason:
  A MetaDOS related bug in PureC. Patch your PureC with supplied patch.

---

Bug:
  ARAnyM crashes after start with message:
   "Xlib: async reply ...."

Reason:
  A bug in sdltimer (maybe in lib, maybe in ARAnyM, who knows)
  Configure ARAnyM with --disable-sdltimer if you have this problem


Platform dependent known bugs and limitations:
----------------------------------------------

SDL_Timer works properly on Linux only, it seems. So for most other
platforms (including Windows) you have to configure the build with
--disable-sdltimer. Without SDL_Timer the keyboard does not have
full control over the CPU run (sometimes you might not be able
to e.g. quit). Also, the STOP instruction is not emulated properly
in such case, IMHO.

There are three different FPU emulators in ARAnyM, and only the IEEE
version has full 68040 FPU instruction set. On non-Linux-i386 platforms
the uae FPU emulation is used and so some 68040 specific FPU instructions
are missing. This will be fixed eventually.
