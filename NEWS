2002/07/20 - version 0.2.0 released (celebrating the Woody release!)
==========

 Long time since previous release. I have been waiting for finishing
 a couple of promising modules but since Debian 3.0 (AKA Woody) has just
 been released I am releasing ARAnyM as well to celebrate it :-)
 Seriously, we wanted to give you something to play with and test the
 number of changes and new features in ARAnyM while we'll be working
 towards next major release.

 Major news:

   - new graphical user interface for runtime configuration of ARAnyM
     (unfinished yet)

   - EmuTOS being part of ARAnyM binary distribution (TOS 4.04 is not
     required to boot ARAnyM anymore)

   - boot floppy image with essential up-to-date ARAnyM drivers and tools
     (so you can easily upgrade your harddisk images)

 And now more detailed news in ARAnyM since last public release:

 Standa created 'fvdicout.app' which, being based on TosWin II source code
 should bring a complete VT52 emulation for applications with console
 output under fVDI. You'll find it in atari/fvdi/utility folder.

 Heiko Achilles added a 'mouse packet compressor' that is supposed to
 remove any delay when moving with mouse more quickly (or on more loaded
 machine). It may either fix problems you could have with your mouse
 or it can create a new, previously unseen mouse events' bugs. Test
 and let us know.

 The aranymfs (the MetaDOS host filesystem driver) has been converted
 to GCC compilable form. Please beware and test the host filesystem access
 carefully.

 Brand new keyboard hotkeys:

 - Scroll Lock (the mostly unused key on PC keyboards) now switches
   between windowed and fullscreen mode!

 - Ctrl+Pause cold reboots the ARAnyM correctly now

 - Pause key now invokes cool new ARAnyM GUI configuration.

 Please note that the GUI is far from being finished. The only useful
 option is the "Reset" and perhaps also the Quit (for those that can't
 remember the Shift+Pause combo). The GUI will soon be filled with tons
 of configure options so stay tuned...

 Another change from previous versions is that we now require original
 TOS 4.04. Various patched versions we supported before are unsupported
 now. So please get a clean original TOS 4.04 - or give the EmuTOS a try!
 All you need is to empty the "TOS=" option in the ARAnyM config file.

 Long filename->TOS 8.3 format conversion was improved so that it now
 handles also filenames ending with a dot.

 A long standing bug in Yamaha emulation was fixed. This helps mainly
 the lowlevel emulation of parallel port access. The parallel/printer
 port is emulated so accurately that even PARCP works flawlessly.
 Note though that this is not enabled automatically as it requires
 root privileges to run ARAnyM. We are going to add other methods
 for accessing the host parallel port in a more user/kernel friendly
 way.

 I know that after releasing the input focus with Alt+Ctrl+Esc combo
 sometimes the Alt+Ctrl stay held down. I added a special code for 
 removing the stale Alt+Ctrl state. Please let us know if this helped.

 Hackers Guide (hguide.txt) was updated. If you want to hack on ARAnyM
 you should read it first.

 From the other exciting news: Patrice Mandin has started work on DSP
 emulation for ARAnyM. He's actually nearly finished it so it may be
 available in the next version of ARAnyM already!

 Johan Klockars also started rewriting some pretty core things in the
 fVDI ARAnyM driver and fVDI itself so expect the next major release
 to be a real killer (in both good and bad sense ;-)

 BTW, if there is a developer that would be willing to finish the nearly
 working ECE (Ethernet Card Emulation) then please join us in ARAnyM
 development mailing list.

 Generally, there is a lot of cool things to work on in ARAnyM project
 so if you want to help out then write to us.


2002/04/22 - version 0.1.7 released
==========

 Sound is working! Put the atari/sound/zmagxsnd.prg to your AUTO
 folder and Aniplayer (after switching to XBIOS in its Sound Config
 dialog) should play all sounds nicely!

 Several very bad or annoying bugs in aranymfs fixed. Now it should
 be real usable.

 It's possible to Reboot the machine by pressing Ctrl+Pause.
 IKBD problems after reboot will be fixed in next release.

 Two new config file options: "Redir_Console" and "Redit_Printer".
 If set to "yes" the BIOS console (2 and 5) or printer (0) output
 is redirected to the host console.

 RPM spec file for ARAnyM. If your Linux distro is RPM based you may want
 to try out the following command:
    'rpm -tb aranym-0.1.7.tar.gz'
 It should build a binary RPM package of aranym which you can then install
 the usual way (rpm -i aranym*.rpm).


2002/04/12 - version 0.1.6 released
==========

 Serious problem with NMI not being able to break STOPped CPU
 fixed. Also when compiled with --disable-timer it now generates
 system 200 Hz interrupt correctly even when the CPU is STOPped.


2002/04/11 - version 0.1.5 released (please update your fVDI driver!)
==========

 Since the previous public release we made a lot of changes. Probably the most
 significant is the large rewrite of CPU. Current ARAnyM can be compiled
 with full PMMU (Memory Management Unit of Motorola 68040 CPU). This brings
 the ability to run FreeMiNT with memory protection enabled. It also opens
 door for running Unix-like operating systems (Linux or NetBSD for m68k)
 but unfortunately the current level of HW emulation is not sufficient for
 those yet. But we are working on it (and gladly accept any help from you!)

 While rewriting the CPU we also updated the FPU. ARAnyM's FPU now fully
 supports all MC68881/2 as well as MC86040 FPU instructions.
 
 There is also a developer version of ARAnyM with JIT (just-in-time compiler)
 but it is not stable enough yet.

 SGI/Irix is yet another supported host platform and we have added preliminary
 support for MiNT as the host platform ;-)

 On most supported host platforms the memory access was accelerated (thus
 the overall speed of ARAnyM increased).

 ARAnyM is the first Atari compatible platform with support for the native
 instruction interface (Native Features). That will bring new possibilities
 for next generation Atari software.

 AranymFS - our system clean MetaDOS driver for accessing host filesystem
 was greatly bugfixed. During debugging of this some Atari software proven
 to be ill-designed (such as PureC IDE - it is unable to cope with files
 on MetaDOS drives due to misusing certain range of GEMDOS handles. We
 developed a patch for it so now you can enjoy compiling with PureC on
 host filesystem). Besides that, there is a beta version of AranymFS.XFS
 driver for MiNT!

 The other improvements include new IDE emulation (including ATAPI CD-ROM,
 try e.g. ejecting the CD from within Thing desktop), new config file
 is created with correct default values, and many other fixes.

 Note that due to changes in fVDI host driver you need to update your
 fVDI Atari driver - there is a precompiled fvdi.sys in "atari/fvdi/drivers".
 Also you might want to update the AranymFS driver for MetaDOS/BetaDOS:
 it's also available as a precompiled binary in "atari/aranymfs/" folder.

 Last note: printing to Atari parallel port is now redirected to the console
 where you started ARAnyM from... This is not the final solution but rather
 a little hack that can be used for debug prints.


2002/02/12 - version 0.0.21 released
==========

 ARAnyM has a new version of IDE emulation. It should work on more
 platforms (*BSD, for example).

 Generally the portability is better (fixes also in ndebug and aranymfs).

 There is a new untested alpha version of aranym.xfs for MiNT.

 And we have a new long detailed users guide in documentation.txt file.


2002/01/28 - version 0.0.20 released
==========

 ARAnyM is at least +33% faster than the previous release. We greatly
 optimized the CPU memory access time and also interrupt emulation.

 ARAnyM runs with the SDL TimerThread by default again. This gives us
 more flexibility (see the STOP insn below) and is necessary for
 the upcoming JIT CPU (just-in-time compilation of m68k code).

 ARAnyM supports STOP instruction that put the CPU to sleep. This works
 perfectly in latest EmuTOS (CVS version). ARAnyM does not eat CPU
 cycles when the EmuTOS is idle.

 ARAnyM configuration file changed its location and got more options:
 all ARAnyM user files are now located in $HOME/.aranym/ folder.
 The configuration file is named "config" (thus the complete path is
 $HOME/.aranym/config). The configuration file is created automatically
 if it is not found. The old $HOME/.aranymrc is not read, you have to
 update your new config file by hand.

 New noteworthy command line options include "--refresh <x>" where you
 can specify the VIDEL refresh.

 ARAnyM now contains special support for native harddrive access from
 EmuTOS. This allows EmuTOS to actually boot from a harddrive attached
 to ARAnyM machine.

 Many many fixes - in floppy (formatting works), fVDI driver (colors after
 resolution change), NVRAM (year 2002 not 2001), MFP (TimerC) and more.

 Great thing for all Debian users - ARAnyM is now included in Debian Sid
 distribution.

 Last but not least - ARAnyM runs under Windows as well. You can compile
 the released source code with Cygwin to get Windows executable.

 Look into ChangeLog for more details.


2001/12/06 - version 0.0.11 released
==========
 The keyboard emulation in aranym has been rewritten and is based on pure
 scancodes now. Thanks to that the original TOS kbd tables should work on
 regular PC keyboards (at least English/USA works perfectly). You should be
 able to use any NVRAM configuration tool to switch your TOS kbd layout
 nationality from USA (now default) to any other of the six(teen) defined.
 Don't forget to update the Clocky.prg (current version available in
 src/atari/tools/ does not alter the original TOS keyboard by default).

 Previously there were errors when reading floppies with FastRAM enabled.
 Use the latest FastRAM v2.0 (available in src/atari/tools) and floppies
 will be OK - well, apart from those large floppies (4 MB and more) from
 STonX. These are NOT VALID floppies but rather single partitions of
 a harddrive. ARAnyM will handle them when we implement XHDI emulation.

 IKBD emulation was fixed so that Videlity config program works now. Videlity
 is a Falcon screen enhancer (freeware). Get it and enjoy Videl at 1024x768 :)

 fVDI was greatly improved so you might not need to play with Videlity at all.
 Use the new aranym.sys driver available in src/atari/fvdi/drivers/ and also
 the new fVDI.prg itself (src/atari/fvdi/).

 The patches for TOS 4.04 were cleaned up a lot. If you were using
 a prepatched TOS version please delete it and get the original TOS 4.04.

 IDE emulation was fixed so that formatting and partitioning of ext2 by
 a MiNT installer work now properly.

 Various bugfixes were done including ndebug, aranymfs, MMU040, command line
 parameters and more.

 If you want to debug aranym itself (in gdb) or to debug something inside
 of aranym using the internal debugger then you might want to disable the
 mouse grabbing completely: simply run aranym --nomouse (or -N).

 Last but not least - ARAnyM has been successfully ported to Solaris (with
 help of Francois LE COAT) and Windows/cygwin (thanks to Olivier Landemarre).


2001/11/06
==========
 The TOS patch we used included WinX by a mistake. That's been removed.
 Now you'll need to install real GEMRAM and also WinX to your auto folder
 if you wish to use the WinX AES enhancements. Please note that the
 GEMRAM 1.0 from the Aratools does not work. It actually didn't work for
 a long time. Use the real GEMRAM (that copies ROM to RAM) instead if you
 want to use WinX.


2001/11/01
==========

 Mouse behavior fixed:
  1) you can release mouse grab by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Esc (VMware compatible)
  2) you can grab mouse by click the left mouse button (VMware compatible)
  3) if the Atari mouse driver is active, you can release mouse by moving
     the mouse off the window and by moving back you grab it again. This
     can be disabled by setting "AutoGrabMouse=No" in the config file.

 You can save the config file by 'aranym -s' (or --save). This is useful
 if you want to see newly added options. You can also choose a different
 config file by 'aranym -c /path/to/different/aranymrc'. This even works
 together: 'aranym -c /tmp/aranymrc.example -s' will create a fresh config
 file in /tmp with all default values.


2001/10/29
==========
--rom removed
--floppy added

aranymrc.example updated

.aranymrc has a new option "EmuTOS" that holds a path to the EmuTOS.
When "EmuTOS=" is defined the "TOS=" is ignored (EmuTOS is the future! :)


2001/10/18
==========

Aranym is now able to work with the original TOS 4.04.


2001/10/02
==========
--ttram renamed to --fastram
-T renamed to -F
--grab_mouse and -g removed (mouse is always grabbed)

.aranymrc has a new option "cookie_MCH" that holds hex value.
Example: cookie_MCH = 0x3000 is for standard Falcon _MCH
