General (all platforms) known bugs:
-----------------------------------

Bug: fVDI (ir its aranym driver) disables bconout during boot
Reason: unknown, probably a bug in the driver
Solution: unknown, needs to be debugged and fixed
--
Bug: PureC cannot open project file on host filesystem.
Reason: A MetaDOS related bug in PureC.
Solution: Patch your PureC with supplied patch.
--
Bug: Programs started from MetaDOS HOSTFS sometime crash.
Reason: A MetaDOS bug in its Pexec implementation.
Solution: Forget MetaDOS and use BetaDOS 3.12+ instead.
--
Bug: Videlity Configure Tool does not work (hangs during launching)
Reason:
  Dirty delay loop - while(clock() == certain_value). This may not work
  even under multitasking system and does not work in current ARAnyM where
  TimerC interrupts come in pairs (100 Hz host interrupt).
Solution:
  General solution is to get a more precise host timer interrupt (at least
  200 Hz). Specific (and suggested) solution is to stop using Videlity and
  replace it with BlowUP030 or something similar.


Platform dependent known bugs and limitations:
----------------------------------------------

MacOS X does not like floating videoram. Compile with --enable-fixedvideoram.

Windows 95/98/99/00 do not support direct disk access (Windows NT/2K/XP do).
This is a limitation of Cygwin, or rather a limitation of the windows itself.

Windows do not allow switching from window to full-screen and back using
the ScrollLock key.  This is probably just wrong mapping for the ScrollKey

Only Linux currently supports TUNTAP based Ethernet emulation (AFAIK).
Although http://home.sprintmail.com/~dtrout/Hercules/ctci-w32-index.html
gives some chance to Windows users as well.

Only Linux-ia32 (x86) currently supports JIT compiler for the CPU emulator.
