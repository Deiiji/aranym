ARAnyM source code consists of several parts. Some were taken from other
projects (Basilisk II, Bochs, STonX) - we thank to them and to their
authors for releasing the code under GPL.

The ARAnyM core, glue and additional features were written by the
following main ARAnyM developers:

- 68040 MMU (Memory Management Unit) emulation (in progress)
- 68040 JIT (in progress)
- ndebug (New Debug)
- TV conf GUI (nobody seen it yet :)
