These are the first basic tools for Aranym:

- fastram.prg v2.0 that detects FastRAM size automatically and reserves
  64kB block of RAM for DMA operations to FastRAM (Cookie "_FRB")

- clocky.prg that write actual mouse position to $f9000e/$f90010
  (It was faster to implement it into Clocky (TM) than to write a new TSR).

Soon there will be a tool for arafs that will edit the
MetaDOS' config.sys file automatically.

The archive you can find at the following URL:
ftp://aranym.sophics.cz/pub/aranym/aratools.tgz

Finally all these tools will be merged into one AraKit.
