      Please note that ARAnyM is not finished yet. It's a work in progress and the current
      status is somewhere between alpha and beta. It may work but we can't guarantee 
      anything. Better backup your data first and be ready for everything :-)
      <p/>
      Most up-to-date source code is available in the <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>.
      <p/>
      Nightly CVS snapshot (generated at 02:00 CET) is <a href="http://atari.sh.cvut.cz/ftp/other/snapshot.tar.gz">here</a>. The configure script is pre-generated in this tar file so you don't have to run "./autogen.sh" - "./configure" and "make" is enough.
      <p/>
      Regular releases (source, binary and disk images) happen to be at
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41106">Sourceforge.net</a>.
      <p/>
      For running ARAnyM you will also need TOS 4.04 from Falcon (available <a href="http://www.atariroms.fsnet.co.uk/">here</a>) or EmuTOS (fresh from <a href="http://emutos.sf.net/">CVS</a>).
