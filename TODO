Things to do (written by Joy, volunteers ask in the mailing list)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fix bugs:
- colon as filename case sensitivity flag in HostFS - see Xavier's msg in ML
- find out why changing IDE parameters and Rebooting doesn't show up in linux
- short parameter for lilo in manpage is wrong ("-s") but source is OK
- when mouse grab on startup is off grabbing mouse no longer possible
- after mouse ungrab/re-grab certain shift/control/alt key seems to be pressed
- improve the whole mouse grab/ungrab - auto grab could grab mouse
  automagically when it enters aranym window only if the window is on top
- correct postal address of GPL
- Disk mngmt: when new disk is inserted by clicking on PATH enable the "Insert"
  automatically.
- store keyboard&mouse setting to config file
- don't store empty config entries (ETH2,3,4; DISK2,3,4,5,6,7; HOSFSA-Z, ..)

TODO generally:
- configurable insertion of floppy on bootup (perhaps also IDE CD?)

TODO in keyboard support:
- loadable keyboard layout (similar to hatari)
- editable keyboard layout (need WYSIWYG - impossible in 320x200)

TODO in GUI-SDL:
- change GUI font loading routine - load standard TOS font (2048/4096 bytes)
  directly (instead of some MS Windows bitmap)
- fileselector: sorting by file type (folders first) and then by file .ext
- edit field: allow upper case and generally fix keyboard input in SDL
- create other dialogs for editing the rest of config file settings

TODO in TOS patches and utilities:
- automatic updater of BDCONFIG.SYS
- separate mouse driver from Clocky and make it NatFeat based
- enforce 0x50000 _MCH value (warn user if they have 0x30000)
- finish and publish TOS XHDI disk driver

TODO in documentation:
- update the man page (and fix two manpages in RPM)
- keep working on ARAnyM Hackers Guide (hguide.txt).

TODO in ARAnyM source code itself:
- add proper copyright header to every edited file (see main.cpp)
- remove RCS keywords (they complicate comparing and merging of revisions)
- clean up, tidy up. Indent. Comment. Document.


Some hot ideas (before they get forgotten)
------------------------------------------

Note that the name before a TODO item doesn't mean the item is assigned to
that particular programmer but rather who is author of the idea :-)

- Petr: make.sh magic: "nfeth-config.c" build by ./make.sh of the xif.

- Petr: write some doc about bridging the tuntap - perhaps the following
       URL could help?
       http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO-3.html#ss3.1

- Petr: Clipboard sharing between host and atari. Some URLs for inspiration:
  http://www.idata.sk/~robo/mpcb/
  http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt

  Basic idea: C:\CLIPBRD\SCRAP.TXT is copied to CLIPBOARD on X11 host
  and vice-versa (during input focus changes).

  Extra cool idea: PRIMARY selection on X11 could be stored to IKBD buffer
  directly so it would simulate typing.

- Petr: ARAnyM should test if SDL timers work OK at startup and if not, stop
       booting and exit gracefully with a loud warning (e.g. on NetBSD).

- Petr: emulating a serial port compatible with MiNT/HSMODEM

- Petr: extend the config file routines to save also some comments above
  each head section. Example:

  # the following section defines hotkeys. Format is 
  # hotkey = keycode : modifiers
  # where keycode and modifiers are defined in SDL_keysym.h
  [HOTKEYS]

- Milan: distributed dispatcher for JIT compiler sigsegv handler
  UPDATE: partially done, slower :-(

- Milan: SIGINT ndebug problem solution

- Milan: --with-opengl-prefix

- STanda: hostfs.cpp: enable debug and implement all NOT IMPLEMENTED needed
         methods.

- patrice: rework dsp thread synchronization. It seems it may hang sometimes.

- patrice: full automake/autoconf support.
