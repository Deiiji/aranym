aranym.xfs
==========

The xfs contains only the HOSTFS (NatFeat) driven .XFS interface
implementation stub mounted to u:\nativefs.
Later there might be some more devices so that we would only need
single FreeMiNT kernel module (aranym.xfs).


hostfs.dos
==========

This is the MetaDOS driver that makes use of the NatFeat .XFS
interface. Basicaly it is the FreeMiNT file IO GEMDOS
implementation (FreeMiNT_CVS/sys/ dosfile.c dosdir.c)
mangled so that it compiles as a standalone binary.


Installation
------------
MetaDOS driver:
 * copy new hostfs.dos to your AUTO folder and add the entries
   into your config.sys (or bdconfig.sys) - like for aranymfs.dos
 * configure your paths - not implemented yet

note: due to the bugs you might need to keep the aranymfs.dos to be
      able to run programs under TOS.

FreeMiNT .XFS driver:
 * copy new aranym.xfs (replace the old one) to your
   bootdrive:\MINT folder
 * configure your paths - not implemented yet


BUGS
----
hostfs.doc
 - relocatable programs crash
   - a Pexec problem (most probable stack mangling)

aranym.xfs
 - the symlinks are not finished (work somehow).
 - other problems might occur as it is in the early stage of
   its live

Compilation
-----------
 * to compile the xfs you need the source tree of FreeMiNT (at least
   version 1.15.10b), set up so that it compiles. Point the
   FREEMINT_SRC_HOME environment variable to its home (the
   COPYING.MiNT file is there).
 * use make.sh to compile
 * the binaries are placed into the .bin subfolder
