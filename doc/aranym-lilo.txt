Hello,

Patrice made a Lilo (linux loader) for Aranym. It means Aranym directly
load a linux/m68k kernel image (gzipped or not), then run it.

Aranym must be compiled with the following options, if you want to try:
--enable-fixedvideoram --enable-fullmmu --enable-lilo --disable-nfcdrom
In config file, disable mousegrabbing (in case of an infinite loop) and JIT.

And run aranym with '-l' or '--lilo'.

Some disk images to play with are available at

Please note that MMU is not 100% bugfixed so Linux is not running properly
yet. But Andreas is working on it hard...
