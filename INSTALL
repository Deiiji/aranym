You have to have SDL 1.2.x, get it from http://www.libsdl.org/
or from your distribution vendor.

If you run a flavor of Unix or Linux, go to src/Unix folder.

If you got the source code from CVS then start with ./autogen.sh

Then type ./configure && make

Not sure about make install but you can start aranym directly by
typing ./aranym.

It's a good idea to edit the config file ~/.aranymrc, an example you'll
find in doc/src/atari/aranymrc.example.
