Before 0.8.0 release:
---------------------
- automagically updated CONFIG.SYS/BDCONFIG.SYS
- some doc update (networking, disk image, afros)

Roadmap:
--------

0.8.0 should bring long-awaited networking support and next level
of host filesystem access.

0.9.0 should come with direct partition access and free XHDI disk driver

1.0.0 should be distributed as a CD ISO image, installable on wide range
  of wintel hardware.

Some hot ideas (before they get forgotten)
============================================

Note that the name before a TODO item doesn't mean the item is assigned to
that particular programmer but rather who is the author of the idea :-)

- joy: make.sh magic: "nfeth-config.c" build by ./make.sh of the xif.

- joy: detect loop lockups (e.g. "Illegal instruction: 00e0 at 00000030"
       repeated endlessly) and allow restarting ARAnyM gracefully

- joy: patch for fixing MetaDOS Pexec bug (maybe not needed as BetaDOS is OK)

- joy: make the PureC patch more error-proof

- joy: put all ARAnyM patches and drivers together to a nice package

- joy: diskimage updating config file automatically

- joy: fix the mouse jumping in fVDI with STOP#$2000 enabled FreeMiNT kernel

- joy: Clipboard sharing between host and atari. Some URLs for inspiration:
  http://www.idata.sk/~robo/mpcb/
  http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt

  Basic idea: C:\CLIPBRD\SCRAP.TXT is copied to CLIPBOARD on X11 host
  and vice-versa (during input focus changes).

  Extra cool idea: PRIMARY selection on X11 could be stored to IKBD buffer
  directly so it would simulate typing.

- joy: aranym --version should display 'Capabilities' - a list of the
  features it was built with (ETHERNET, DSP, JIT, OpenGL, HOSTFS, ..)

- joy: printing to file (/dev/lp)

- joy: emulating a serial port compatible with MiNT/HSMODEM

- joy: rewrite all HW modules to make use of BASE_IO::handle_read/write()

- joy: in fdc.cpp: replace HWget_b() and HWput_b() with something more
       appropriate for inter-module communication

- joy: in hardware.cpp: HWget_l/HWput_l should not have the special case
       for HW_IDE. Best would be to implement word and longword HW access
       emulation directly for all modules.

- joy: document the way the aranym works - especially the hardware
       emulation (ARAnyM Hackers Guide).

- joy: document the command line switches, keyboard combos and write Users
       Guide.

- Milan: full revision of CPU/FPU instr. set

- Milan: distributed dispatcher for JIT compiler sigsegv handler

- Milan: gdb as debugger for ARAnyM

- Milan: SIGINT ndebug problem solution

- STanda: hostfs.cpp: enable debug and implement all NOT IMPLEMENTED needed
         methods.
