- extfs: the drives are assignable from commandline option -disk (-d)
  The AUTO/CONFIG.SYS must still contain the conresponding drive-letter
  assignment with the -d options on the commandline.

- the paramenters.cpp contains the drive assignment which is read by
  ExtFs.init() method (called from main_unix.cpp)

- the short -debug option was redesigned to -D

2001/05/29 - PS - version increased to 0.0.3
- major speed up (22 -> 27 thousand dhrystones) thanks to moving setjmp()
  out of main CPU loop

- excep_no var removed from memory.cpp and newcpu.cpp

- fixed VBL invocation (main_unix.cpp)

2001/05/29 - PS - version increased to 0.0.2
- uae_cpu/memory.h - you can enable or disable CHECK_MEMORY_END.
  When enabled, direct_truecolor bombs out in early stage of TOS boot (because
  TOS cannot write to videoram).
  When disabled, FastRAM works (just run FASTRAM.PRG from the desktop and
  you'll get 32 MB of additional fast ram).

- 'boot_color_depth' switch works now thanks to late initializing of RTC module
  in HWInit().

- 'monitor' switch allows you to choose between VGA and TV connected on Videl
  output.

- 'direct_truecolor' switch allows you to patch TOS so that Videl VideoRAM
  is set directly to host's VideoRAM. Thus VIDEL writes directly to host's
  VGA card video memory (if framebuffer is used as the SDL_VIDEODRIVER).

- implemented proper Bus Error (hardware.cpp and others). This helps
  in a number of places, namely in FPU detection routines.

- fixed floppy emulation (fdc.cpp). STonX code contained wrong HW register
  addresses. I found it when I enabled FastRAM - the FDC was crashing
  the virtual machine.

- added memory bounds checking (memory.h). Ill behaving programs (and bad FDC
  emulation, as mentioned above :) won't crash the virtual machine anymore!

- new memory allocation (main_unix.cpp), enables 32 MB of FastRAM.
