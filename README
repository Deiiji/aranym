 2) What is this?
 ----------------

ARAnyM is a multiplatform Virtual Machine of an enhanced Atari Falcon040.
The reason for writing ARAnyM is to provide Atari power users with a faster
and better machines ever.

Important: ARAnyM is far from being finished. Consider this to be an alpha
version and a work-in-progress. Sorry for total lack of documentation.
And beware - ARAnyM is not yet very usable - some of its features are
unstable and the runtime configuration is not done yet.


 3) Compiling and running
 ------------------------

First, you need the SDL library, you can get it at:
 http://www.libsdl.org
Of course, you need GNU-C++ and (GNU) Make, too!

Change to the src/Unix directory and run ./configure.
If you got the source archive from cvs then run ./autogen.sh instead.
You may want to check all the compile time options with ./configure --help.
Then compile it by typing "make".  If all works fine, you'll get the
executable "aranym". "make install" maybe the next step (be root
if you haven't changed the destination folder from /usr/local during
the configure phase).

Try starting ARAnyM with the option "--help" to find out more about its
command line parameters. Also look at src/atari/aranymrc.example file
for inspiration and/or generate/update your own ~/.aranymrc by starting
"aranym --save".

Then you'll have to obtain the original TOS 4.04 from Falcon. Copy it
to the following path: "/usr/local/share/aranym/ROM".
You can change this path either before compiling (try ./configure --help)
or in the ARAnyM configuration file ("TOS=/path/to/TOS").

ARAnyM should be ready for running with EmuTOS. Simply set the "EmuTOS="
config option to point to your EmuTOS ROM image file. The TOS= is ignored
in such case.

You may also want a harddisk - either an image of it or a real thing
from your Atari computer. We are working on providing a couple of 
disk images. Stay tuned.

The file INSTALL already provides more information on this topic.

Just a couple of hints:

If you want to run ARAnyM in window under X11, start it without any parameter.
Otherwise start aranym with "-f" for fullscreen (even on console). This is 
to work around a bug in SDL.

If your mouse doesn't work correctly on console you may want to set the
SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2 environment variable to 1 (this is if you have IMPS2 mouse).

export SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2=1; aranym


 4) Keyboard shortcuts
 ---------------------

While the emulator is running, you can quit it by pressing Shift+Break.
And if you started ARAnyM with the debugger option, you can enter
the debugger by pressing Alt+Break.

F11 is the Help key while F12 is the Undo key.
PageUp/PageDown are mapped to Shift+ArrowUp/ArrowDown which is the
most used combination in GEM programs.

Alt+PrintScreen grabs a screenshot.
