<HOW-TO>

Compiling ARAnyM 0.8.0 beta 3 under Cygwin
------------------------------------------

You first need a working Cygwin env with gcc installed ( 
http://www.cygwin.com ).

You need a working libSDL before compiling ARAnyM

SDL 1.2.5
---------
Download, and decompress SDL 1.2.5 sources ( http://www.libsdl.org ). 
You can optionnaly also use opengl and directx headers provided there 
and/or install nasm.
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && make install
$ mv /usr/bin/sdl-config /usr/bin/sdl-config.bak
To allow compiling ARAnyM using Cygwin and not Mingw.
$ cp /usr/include/SDL/* /usr/include
To workaround the fact that sdl-config is disabled.


Now we can compile ARAnyM itself.

ARAnyM 0.8.0 beta 3
-------------------
Download and decompress ARAnyM 0.8.0 beta 3 sources.
$ cd src/Unix
$ ./configure --disable-ethernet && make

Replace the previous line by "$ ./autogen.sh --disable-ethernet && make" 
if you pulled sources from CVS. You will need autoconf and automake for 
this.

If you wants to use ARAnyM as an unix app.
$ make install
$ cp /usr/lib/SDL.dll /usr/local/bin/SDL.dll

Otherwise, just put
- aranym.exe
- SDL.dll
- cygwin1.dll
- aranym/font8.bmp
in one location. You will also need an EmuTOS or TOS 4.04 image and a 
config file. The easy way is to use aranym-0.8.0beta3-win.zip as a 
template. Petr already did the hard work ;) .
