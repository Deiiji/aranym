Things that must be done before first beta release:
===================================================

Critical:
- fix system timer (200 Hz) - the system time slows down under heavy load now.

Technical:
- system wide object with user settings that will include bx_options from ata.cpp.
  Actually bx_options was such object - look into Plex86 for inspiration.

- CMOS (NVRAM) settings stored on disk

Cosmetical:
- mouse pointer must be sync'ed with the host mouse (in X-Windows)

- cleaned up source code

The goal for the first beta is to get functional Atari/TOS machine replacement
fully usable for regular GEM users.

Estimated amount of work for first beta release: 40 clovekohodin

Things for 1.0 release:
=======================

- Networking for MiNTNet (like in vmware)

- mouse pointer shared between X-Windows and aranym (like in vmware)

- fVDI integrated

The goal for version 1.0 is to have real TOS/MiNT compatible machine usable by
all Atari power users/MiNTers. Key elements are TCP/IP networking, large
screen resolution in high color/true color, fast CPU/FPU and plenty of RAM.

Estimated time for 1.0 release: summer/fall 2001.

Things for 2.0 release:
=======================

- configuration in GUI for X-Windows (GNOME/KDE)

- perhaps port of aranym to Windows

- Yamaha sound, DSP emulation, MMU040

- serial port, parallel port, joysticks etc.

The goal for 2.0 is total Atari machine replacement usable by every Atari BFU.
It should be able to boot Linux-m68k to prove 100% hardware compatibility.

Estimated time for 2.0 release: depends on number of attracted programmers.
Either never (due to lack of interest) or rather soon after 1.0 release.
