Things to do (written by Joy, volunteers ask in the mailing list)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fix bugs:
- change default Ungrab combination to Right Control
- "-d" cmdline option doesn't work (doesn't win over config file settings)
- [PARTITION] settings into SETUP GUI ASAP
- [HOSTFS] settings into SETUP GUI ASAP
- [ETHx] update with DNS IP address (requires FreeMiNT update)
- colon as filename case sensitivity flag in HostFS - see Xavier's msg in ML
  Solution: come up with URL like paths: "file://path?parameter=value"
  where parameter is e.g. CaseSensitivity.
  Thanks to file:// scheme this should even be backward compatible.
- improve the whole mouse grab/ungrab - auto grab could grab mouse
  automagically when it enters aranym window only if the window is on top
- correct postal address of GPL
- Disk mngmt: don't show the short path in the editable field - if someone edits it the "..." shortened version gets stored to configuration.
- don't store empty config entries (ETH2,3,4; DISK2,3,4,5,6,7; HOSFSA-Z, ..)

Feature requests:
- update ARAnyM NVRAM before booting the OS with the current host locale.
  Could help with non-English keyboards to be usable out-of-the-box.

TODO generally:
- configurable insertion of floppy on bootup (perhaps also IDE CD?)

TODO in keyboard support:
- loadable keyboard layout (similar to hatari)
- editable keyboard layout (need WYSIWYG - impossible in 320x200)

TODO in GUI-SDL:
- change GUI font loading routine - load standard TOS font (2048/4096 bytes)
  directly (instead of some MS Windows bitmap)
- fileselector: sorting by file type (folders first) and then by file .ext
- edit field: allow upper case and generally fix keyboard input in SDL
- create other dialogs for editing the rest of config file settings

TODO in TOS patches and utilities:
- automatic updater of BDCONFIG.SYS
- separate mouse driver from Clocky and make it NatFeat based
- finish and publish TOS XHDI disk driver

TODO in ARAnyM source code itself:
- add proper copyright header to every edited file (see main.cpp)
- remove RCS keywords (they complicate comparing and merging of revisions)
- clean up, tidy up. Indent. Comment. Document.


Some hot ideas (before they get forgotten)
------------------------------------------

Note that the name before a TODO item doesn't mean the item is assigned to
that particular programmer but rather who is author of the idea :-)

- Petr: make.sh magic: "nfeth-config.c" build by ./make.sh of the xif.

- Petr: write some doc about bridging the tuntap - perhaps the following
       URL could help?
       http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Ethernet-Bridge-netfilter-HOWTO-3.html#ss3.1

- Petr: Clipboard sharing between host and atari. Some URLs for inspiration:
  http://www.idata.sk/~robo/mpcb/
  http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/clipboards.txt

  Basic idea: C:\CLIPBRD\SCRAP.TXT is copied to CLIPBOARD on X11 host
  and vice-versa (during input focus changes).

  Extra cool idea: PRIMARY selection on X11 could be stored to IKBD buffer
  directly so it would simulate typing.

- Petr: ARAnyM should test if SDL timers work OK at startup and if not, stop
       booting and exit gracefully with a loud warning (e.g. on NetBSD).

- Petr: emulating a serial port compatible with MiNT/HSMODEM

- Petr: extend the config file routines to save also some comments above
  each head section. Example:

  # the following section defines hotkeys. Format is 
  # hotkey = keycode : modifiers
  # where keycode and modifiers are defined in SDL_keysym.h
  [HOTKEYS]

- Milan: distributed dispatcher for JIT compiler sigsegv handler
  UPDATE: partially done, slower :-(

- Milan: SIGINT ndebug problem solution

- Milan: --with-opengl-prefix

- STanda: hostfs.cpp: enable debug and implement all NOT IMPLEMENTED needed
         methods.

- patrice: rework dsp thread synchronization. It seems it may hang sometimes.

- patrice: full automake/autoconf support.

- patrice: C++-ize the input layer, get rid of various keytables hacks.

- patrice: fvdi aranym.sys driver (m68k side) must follow the host surface
  R,G,B,A organization.
