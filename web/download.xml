      Please note that ARAnyM is not finished yet. It's a work in progress and the current
      status is somewhere between alpha and beta. It may work but we can't guarantee 
      anything. Better backup your data first and be ready for everything :-)
      <p/>
      Most up-to-date source code is available in the <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>.
      <p/>
      The <a href="ftp://ftp.sophics.cz/pub/aranym/">ARAnyM FTP archive</a> contains
      <a href="ftp://ftp.sophics.cz/pub/aranym/src/">source code snapshots</a>,
      various <a href="ftp://ftp.sophics.cz/pub/aranym/tools/">tools</a>
      and also <a href="ftp://ftp.sophics.cz/pub/aranym/disk/">disk images</a>.
      <p/>
      If you are working with your original harddisk then just download the Aratools
      to get FastRAM support and enhanced mouse sharing between host and Atari.
      However if you don't have any harddisk then better start with the prepared disk image,
      it will save you a lot of troubles.
      <p/>
      For running ARAnyM you will also need TOS 4.04 from Falcon, available <a href="http://www.atariroms.fsnet.co.uk/">here</a>.
