  ARAnyM
  ------

This is an unifinished alpha version (work-in-progress) of our Falcon040
virtual machine. There is no documentation yet, sorry.

Just a couple of hints:

You will need an image of 68040 compatible TOS 4.04 for running ARAnyM.

You may also need a harddisk - either an image of it or a real thing
from your Atari computer. We are working on providing a couple of 
disk images. Stay tuned.

For compiling and running you may check the INSTALL document.

For latest changes see ChangeLog.

For future changes see TODO file.

If you want to run in window under X11, start aranym without any parameter.
Otherwise start aranym with "-f" for fullscreen (even on console).

If your mouse doesn't work correctly on console you may want to set the
SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2 environment variable to 1 (this is if you have IMPS2 mouse).

export SDL_MOUSEDEV_IMPS2=1; ./aranym
