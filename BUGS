General (all platforms) known bugs:
-----------------------------------

Bug:
  Disk images (and probably also physical disk drives) larger than 2 GB
  do not work.

Reason:
  Our IDE emulation code is facing 32-bit barrier in lseek.

Solution:
  Wait for a fix.

--

Bug:
  PureC cannot open project file on host filesystem.

Reason:
  A MetaDOS related bug in PureC.

Solution:
  Patch your PureC with supplied patch.

--

Bug:
  Videlity Configure Tool does not work (hangs during launching)

Reason:
  Dirty delay loop - while(clock() == certain_value). This may not work
  even under multitasking system and does not work in current ARAnyM where
  TimerC interrupts come in pairs (100 Hz host interrupt).

Solution:
  General solution is to get a more precise host timer interrupt (at least
  200 Hz). Specific (and suggested) solution is to stop using Videlity and
  replace it with BlowUP030 or something similar.


Platform dependent known bugs and limitations:
----------------------------------------------

MacOS X does not like floating videoram. Compile with --enable-fixedvideoram.
