      Please note that ARAnyM is not finished yet. It's a work in progress and the current
      status is somewhere between alpha and beta. It may work but we can't guarantee 
      anything. Better backup your data first and be ready for everything :-)
      <p/>
      Most up-to-date source code is available in the <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a>.
      <p/>
      The <a href="ftp://ftp.sophics.cz/pub/aranym/">ARAnyM FTP archive</a> contains
      first source code snapshot (dated 2001/10/19) and the ARAnyM tools.
      You may want to download the tools to get FastRAM support, enhanced mouse 
      support and more.
