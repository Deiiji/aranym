2002/04/11 - version 0.1.5 released
==========

 Since the previous public release we made a lot of changes. Probably the most
 significant is the large rewrite of CPU. Current ARAnyM can be compiled
 with full PMMU (Memory Management Unit of Motorola 68040 CPU). This brings
 the ability to run FreeMiNT with memory protection enabled. It also opens
 door for running Unix-like operating systems (Linux or NetBSD for m68k)
 but unfortunately the current level of HW emulation is not sufficient for
 those yet. But we are working on it (and gladly accept any help from you!)

 While rewriting the CPU we also updated the FPU. ARAnyM's FPU now fully
 supports all MC68881/2 as well as MC86040 FPU instructions.
 
 There is also a developer version of ARAnyM with JIT (just-in-time compiler)
 but it is not stable enough yet.

 SGI/Irix is yet another supported host platform and we have added preliminary
 support for MiNT as the host platform ;-)

 On most supported host platforms the memory access was accelerated (thus
 the overall speed of ARAnyM increased).

 ARAnyM is the first Atari compatible platform with support for the native
 instruction interface (Native Features). That will bring new possibilities
 for next generation Atari software.

 AranymFS - our system clean MetaDOS driver for accessing host filesystem
 was greatly bugfixed. During debugging of this some Atari software proven
 to be ill-designed (such as PureC IDE - it is unable to cope with files
 on MetaDOS drives due to misusing certain range of GEMDOS handles. We
 developed a patch for it so now you can enjoy compiling with PureC on
 host filesystem).

 The other improvements include new IDE emulation (including ATAPI CD-ROM,
 try e.g. ejecting the CD from within Thing desktop), new config file
 is created with correct default values, and many other fixes.


2002/02/12 - version 0.0.21 released
==========

 ARAnyM has a new version of IDE emulation. It should work on more
 platforms (*BSD, for example).

 Generally the portability is better (fixes also in ndebug and aranymfs).

 There is a new untested alpha version of aranym.xfs for MiNT.

 And we have a new long detailed users guide in documentation.txt file.


2002/01/28 - version 0.0.20 released
==========

 ARAnyM is at least +33% faster than the previous release. We greatly
 optimized the CPU memory access time and also interrupt emulation.

 ARAnyM runs with the SDL TimerThread by default again. This gives us
 more flexibility (see the STOP insn below) and is necessary for
 the upcoming JIT CPU (just-in-time compilation of m68k code).

 ARAnyM supports STOP instruction that put the CPU to sleep. This works
 perfectly in latest EmuTOS (CVS version). ARAnyM does not eat CPU
 cycles when the EmuTOS is idle.

 ARAnyM configuration file changed its location and got more options:
 all ARAnyM user files are now located in $HOME/.aranym/ folder.
 The configuration file is named "config" (thus the complete path is
 $HOME/.aranym/config). The configuration file is created automatically
 if it is not found. The old $HOME/.aranymrc is not read, you have to
 update your new config file by hand.

 New noteworthy command line options include "--refresh <x>" where you
 can specify the VIDEL refresh.

 ARAnyM now contains special support for native harddrive access from
 EmuTOS. This allows EmuTOS to actually boot from a harddrive attached
 to ARAnyM machine.

 Many many fixes - in floppy (formatting works), fVDI driver (colors after
 resolution change), NVRAM (year 2002 not 2001), MFP (TimerC) and more.

 Great thing for all Debian users - ARAnyM is now included in Debian Sid
 distribution.

 Last but not least - ARAnyM runs under Windows as well. You can compile
 the released source code with Cygwin to get Windows executable.

 Look into ChangeLog for more details.


2001/12/06 - version 0.0.11 released
==========
 The keyboard emulation in aranym has been rewritten and is based on pure
 scancodes now. Thanks to that the original TOS kbd tables should work on
 regular PC keyboards (at least English/USA works perfectly). You should be
 able to use any NVRAM configuration tool to switch your TOS kbd layout
 nationality from USA (now default) to any other of the six(teen) defined.
 Don't forget to update the Clocky.prg (current version available in
 src/atari/tools/ does not alter the original TOS keyboard by default).

 Previously there were errors when reading floppies with FastRAM enabled.
 Use the latest FastRAM v2.0 (available in src/atari/tools) and floppies
 will be OK - well, apart from those large floppies (4 MB and more) from
 STonX. These are NOT VALID floppies but rather single partitions of
 a harddrive. ARAnyM will handle them when we implement XHDI emulation.

 IKBD emulation was fixed so that Videlity config program works now. Videlity
 is a Falcon screen enhancer (freeware). Get it and enjoy Videl at 1024x768 :)

 fVDI was greatly improved so you might not need to play with Videlity at all.
 Use the new aranym.sys driver available in src/atari/fvdi/drivers/ and also
 the new fVDI.prg itself (src/atari/fvdi/).

 The patches for TOS 4.04 were cleaned up a lot. If you were using
 a prepatched TOS version please delete it and get the original TOS 4.04.

 IDE emulation was fixed so that formatting and partitioning of ext2 by
 a MiNT installer work now properly.

 Various bugfixes were done including ndebug, aranymfs, MMU040, command line
 parameters and more.

 If you want to debug aranym itself (in gdb) or to debug something inside
 of aranym using the internal debugger then you might want to disable the
 mouse grabbing completely: simply run aranym --nomouse (or -N).

 Last but not least - ARAnyM has been successfully ported to Solaris (with
 help of Francois LE COAT) and Windows/cygwin (thanks to Olivier Landemarre).


2001/11/06
==========
 The TOS patch we used included WinX by a mistake. That's been removed.
 Now you'll need to install real GEMRAM and also WinX to your auto folder
 if you wish to use the WinX AES enhancements. Please note that the
 GEMRAM 1.0 from the Aratools does not work. It actually didn't work for
 a long time. Use the real GEMRAM (that copies ROM to RAM) instead if you
 want to use WinX.


2001/11/01
==========

 Mouse behavior fixed:
  1) you can release mouse grab by pressing Alt+Ctrl+Esc (VMware compatible)
  2) you can grab mouse by click the left mouse button (VMware compatible)
  3) if the Atari mouse driver is active, you can release mouse by moving
     the mouse off the window and by moving back you grab it again. This
     can be disabled by setting "AutoGrabMouse=No" in the config file.

 You can save the config file by 'aranym -s' (or --save). This is useful
 if you want to see newly added options. You can also choose a different
 config file by 'aranym -c /path/to/different/aranymrc'. This even works
 together: 'aranym -c /tmp/aranymrc.example -s' will create a fresh config
 file in /tmp with all default values.


2001/10/29
==========
--rom removed
--floppy added

aranymrc.example updated

.aranymrc has a new option "EmuTOS" that holds a path to the EmuTOS.
When "EmuTOS=" is defined the "TOS=" is ignored (EmuTOS is the future! :)


2001/10/18
==========

Aranym is now able to work with the original TOS 4.04.


2001/10/02
==========
--ttram renamed to --fastram
-T renamed to -F
--grab_mouse and -g removed (mouse is always grabbed)

.aranymrc has a new option "cookie_MCH" that holds hex value.
Example: cookie_MCH = 0x3000 is for standard Falcon _MCH
