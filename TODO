Things for 1.0 release:
=======================

- fix known BUGS

- implement native interface for accessing host parameters. Use it for Clocky
  (mouse wrap at window border), aranymfs (auto editor of config.sys) and
  EmuTOS (harddrives and more).

- printing to file (/dev/lp)

- rewrite all HW modules to make use of BASE_IO::handle_read/write()

- in fdc.cpp: replace HWget_b() and HWput_b() with something more appropriate
              for inter-module communication

- in hardware.cpp: HWget_l/HWput_l should not have the special case for HW_IDE

- full revision of CPU/FPU instr. set

- support for Just-In-Time compilation

- Networking for MiNTNet (like in vmware)

- aranymfs  filesystem
    - the Host OS part should be rewritten nearly from scratch, I have 
      ideas to use some platform independent library and later either VFS lib.
    - m68k code cleanup... the .c file can be easily rewritten to .s.
      This would be useful, not to need the C compiler for this, woudn't be?
    - .xfs filesystem modules for MagiC and MiNT.

- sound using GSXB library

- document the way the aranym works - especially the hardware emulation
  (ARAnyM Hackers Guide)

- document the command line switches, keyboard combos and write Users Guide.

- OS-depend include files, not so redundant includes

- fix uae FPU (add 68040 specific instructions)

- use a better sigsegv handler, some inspirations in BasiliskII and JIT

The goal for version 1.0 is to have real TOS/MiNT compatible machine usable by
all Atari power users/MiNTers. Key elements are TCP/IP networking, large
screen resolution in high color/true color, fast CPU/FPU and plenty of RAM.

Estimated time for 1.0 release: depends on number of attracted and helpful
programmers. Ideally before summer 2002 but only if you help us...
